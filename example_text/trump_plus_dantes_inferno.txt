Trump: Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. [laughter]They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. [applause]Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. [applause]Audience Member: We want Trump. We want Trump.Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. [applause]Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. [applause]Trump: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.Audience Member: We need Trump now.Trump: You're right. [applause]Audience Member: We need Trump now.Trump: Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.Audience Member: We want Trump now.Trump: Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing."Audience Member: We need Trump now. [applause]Trump: We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.Trump: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion Web site.I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site. [applause]Audience: We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump.Trump: Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not.As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know — "Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?"I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.Audience Member: No more free [inaudible].Trump: Thank you.I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, "What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job."And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. [applause]In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. [laughter]But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now."We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. [applause]Audience: Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.Trump: So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully — they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? It won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.Audience: It needs Trump.Trump: Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."Audience Member: Yes.Trump: We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. [applause]And we also need a cheerleader.You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit."He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.Audience Member: But not a leader.Trump: He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. [applause]We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. [applause]And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.So ladies and gentlemen... [applause]I am officially running...[applause]... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. [applause]It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be — they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. [applause]I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. [applause]I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? [applause]I'm going to tell you — thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...Audience Member: Yes, we do. Yes, we do. [applause]Trump: So we need people — I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, "What's your problem?"He said, "You know, I make great product."And I said, "I know. I know that because I buy the product."He said, "I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?"He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."I said, "They send it back?""Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them."Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much — it's like — it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, "That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it."But I have another one, Ford.So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.So I announced that I'm running for president. I would... [applause]... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn't even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they're not good.But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right? "How does that help us? Where is that good"? It's not.So I would say, "Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're [inaudible]. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.So under President Trump, here's what would happen: [applause]The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.And he'll say, "Please, please, please." He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest." Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas. No interest," because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I [inaudible]...[applause]And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a — that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.Audience Member: Absolutely.Trump: So — because we got to make the country rich.It sounds crass. Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass." It's not crass.We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. [applause]But here's what's going to happen:After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. "Please reconsider," I'll say no.He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico." That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.Trump: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say "we're gonna protect." What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now — it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. [applause]But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, "Is he intelligent?"Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.Audience Member: Yes.Trump: Somebody said — thank you, darlin'. [applause]Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."Audience Member: We don't need nice.Trump: That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. [applause]By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? [applause]Great. Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. [applause]So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?"I said, "I don't know." I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person."But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."Trump: They're right about that, but I'm doing it.Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it."I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it."And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. [applause]I've employed — I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. [applause]And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion." So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets."So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.Audience Member: Yeah.Trump: And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion"? I said, "I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it."But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.So the total is $8,737,540,00.Now I'm not doing that... [applause]I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.According to the economists — who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying — that $24 trillion — we're very close — that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.Audience Member: Make America strong.Trump: So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.Audience Member: Yeah. [applause]I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.Audience Member: Yes.Trump: Mark my words. [applause]Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. [applause]I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.Audience Member: Yes. [applause]Trump: I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. [applause]I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. [applause]Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. [applause]Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened" — it's up in the prison area — "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting."I said, "Very interesting."So protect the Second Amendment. [applause]End — end Common Core. Common Core should — it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end — education has to be local.Rebuild the country's infrastructure.Audience Member: Yeah.Trump: Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.Trump: So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. [applause]Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.Audience Member: Yes. [applause]Trump: Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.Audience Member: Yes. [applause]Trump: Sadly, the American dream is dead.Audience Member: Bring it back.Trump: But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]
 Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did.But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.The problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please.Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have.Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation.Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.Thank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth." You can forget that.What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will.Thank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel.With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is.A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks.And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it.So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen.When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.You see, I know about deal making, that's what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying "one of," because I'll be criticized if I say "the," so I'm going to be very diplomatic, "one of," I'll be criticized, I think it isnumber one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying.That's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also.Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.Thank you. And when I say something, I mean it.I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop.When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer.You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now.There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen.President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved.But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States.We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that.And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned.So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for the National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. I would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country  one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It is time to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people, and American security, above all else. That will be the foundation of every decision that I will make. America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The Greatest Generation beat back the Nazis and the Japanese Imperialists. Then we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian Communism. The Cold War lasted for decades, but we won. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan when he said: "tear down this wall." History will not forget what we did. Unfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands of American lives, and many trillions of dollars, were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy. Today, I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. First, Our Resources Are Overextended President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us the resources we need to rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the Presidency who understands this problem and knows how to fix it. Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share. Our allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time  on planes, missiles, ships, equipment  building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense  and, if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump Administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded. Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us. We've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump Administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. President Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel  and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place. Israel, our great friend and the one true Democracy in the Middle East, has been snubbed and criticized by an Administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel  a force for justice and peace  for acting as an impediment to peace in the region. President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power in the Middle East  all at the expense of Israel, our other allies in the region and, critically, the United States. We've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help. Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they are just as confused as our allies, but an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously any more. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there to meet or greet him  perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then, amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia -- it's called no respect. Do you remember when the President made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to get the Olympics for our country, and, after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth place? He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. The list of humiliations goes on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade rules  or apply the leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything. If President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job. Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.  Since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians, the next day we are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apart. We're a humanitarian nation. But the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion, and disarray. We have made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS. And we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy! Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words "radical Islam," even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees. After Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep! Incredible. Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie. Our Ambassador was murdered and our Secretary of State misled the nation  and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil. This will change when I am president. To all our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again. We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests, and the shared interests of our allies. We are getting out of the nation-building business, and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. We need a new, rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, as well as by our close allies. This is how we won the Cold War, and it's how we will win our new and future struggles. First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.  Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States. Events may require the use of military force. But it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War. In this we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence. We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street  they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or worse -- all you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th. And then there's ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must as, a nation, be more unpredictable. But they're going to be gone. And soon. Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.  The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look what's happened to us! Our nuclear weapons arsenal  our ultimate deterrent  has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during that time. The Air Force is about 1/3 smaller than 1991. Pilots are flying B-52s in combat missions today which are older than most people in this room. And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted, and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming. We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned. But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, not one dollar can be wasted. We are also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again  and to put Americans first again. This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might as a nation. We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives us an edge. This includes 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute. A Trump Administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve, and the best care in the world when they return as veterans to civilian life. Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole. And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China to the World Trade Organization  which has been a disaster for the United States  than into stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama Bin Laden, and didn't do it. And then, we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests, and the following will be my priorities. In the Middle East, our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear-sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are our friends. We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes. But we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia  from a position of strength  is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end. Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table. Fixing our relations with China is another important step towards a prosperous century. China respects strength, and by letting them take advantage of us economically, we have lost all of their respect. We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit we must find a way, quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. After I am elected President, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies, and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure  grown out of the Cold War  to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must fight to win. I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary  and will only do so if we have a plan for victory. Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite: a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy  one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake. After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worse shape now in the Middle East than ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton  it has been a complete and total disaster. I will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very persuasive  but we need to use them selectively and with determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it. However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the War in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary was Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their rich oil reserves  something it has wanted to do for decades. And now, to top it all off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That is why I will also look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread "universal values" that not everyone shares, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. These are my goals, as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, and which our friends and allies will respect and welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies. To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again. Many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than their own. Americans must know that we are putting the American people first again. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy  the jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority. No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same. We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down, and will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the U.S. and has emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. Never again. Only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. Their will be consequences for companies that leave the U.S. only to exploit it later. Under a Trump Administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries. I will view the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are. The world is most peaceful, and most prosperous, when America is strongest. America will continually play the role of peacemaker. We will always help to save lives and, indeed, humanity itself. But to play that role, we must make America strong again. We must make America respected again. And we must make America great again. If we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known. Thank you.
Thank you for joining me today.This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.The horror is beyond description.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.We mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss  and pledge our support to any and all who need it.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.[SILENCE]Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.This is a very dark moment in America's history.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people  with force, purpose and determination.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart  and fast  we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.It's not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans  women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people  then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.The male shooter in San Bernardino  again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife  the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.Yet, Hillary Clinton  for months and despite so many attacks  repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.However, Hillary Clinton  who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage  still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.In fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss  it's deadly.The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.I refuse to be politically correct.I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials  and with our allies.I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism  and who will have the support they require to get the job done.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.These Departments refused to comply.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.The public has a right to know how these people got here.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.We can't let this happen.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States  we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our countrythey enslave women, and murder gays.I don't want them in our country.The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan  including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us  is brought to justice.If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .America must do more  much more  to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.It also means we must change our foreign policy.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.America will be a tolerant and open society.America will also be a safe society.We will protect our borders at home.We will defeat ISIS overseas.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.We will make America rich again.We will make America safe again.We will make American Great Again.Thank you.The media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.She can't have it both ways. She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people herein vast numberswho reject our values?Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities  all of our communities.America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.So whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad  and they do know where they are.I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.I want to protect our citizens  all of our citizens.
Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.People have asked me why I am running for President.I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.We come to work together and turn visions into reality.We think big, and then we make it happen.I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton  only by me.The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.It's rigged against you, the American people.Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests  and taking money from special interests.Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund  doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests  in less than 2 years  secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.They totally own her, and that will never change.The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.Those are the stakes.Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.She believes she is entitled to the office.Her campaign slogan is "I'm with her."You know what my response to that is? I'm with you: the American people.She thinks it's all about her.I know it's all about you  I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism  focusing on what's good for America's middle class  to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.That's what we mean by America First.Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.Our Founders understood this.One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for "the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]" in America.Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property  a crime which is continuing to this day.Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.She gets rich making you poor.Here is a quote from the book: "At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clintonat this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas  and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book  deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career  and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars  and unleashed ISIS across the world.No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president."In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.Libya was cooperating.Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Syria was under control.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.ISIS wasn't even on the map.Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen  while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality  and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the officefrom the bottom of my soul, I know this to be trueHer leadership style  volcanic, impulsivedisdainful of the rules set for everyone else  hasn't changed a bit."Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth  with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access  even though he had no national security credentials.Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State  plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments  perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China  putting all of America in danger.Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.National security is also immigration security  and Hillary wants neither.Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way  an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.There is one common theme in all of these reforms.It's going to be America First.This is why the stakes in November are so great.On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that can't change.My message is that things have to change  and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.Then we started thinking small.We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.But that's not who we are.Come this November, we can bring America back  bigger and better, and stronger than ever.We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth  the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment  we will bring it back all the way.Massive new factories will come roaring into our country  breathing life and hope into our communities.Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.Our country is going to start working again.People are going to start working again.Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again  including parents in our inner cities.Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.We are going to make America rich again.We are going to make America safe again.We are going to make America Great Again  and Great Again For EVERYONE.
Thank you.I'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans.Before going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform: the men and women in blue.Our Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism.They save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report.But I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you.The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country.Our whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time.Yet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty.America's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos  and the destruction of our country as we know it.We must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest. Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.It is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end  and to end right now.We went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality.At the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw.We must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.Violent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described "a startling rise in murders," in our major cities.Brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.Too many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.Our inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.I am the law and order candidate.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.Personally, I think she is both.Not only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.Everyone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.We will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair  and we will protect all Americans.Without safety, we have nothing!It is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again  For Everyone.That promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.The men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.Now is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.We made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you.But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made  not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.President Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that "it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be."She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run  that's because she has been part of the rigged system.Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives  instead of spending time with real people in real pain.The disconnect in America is deep.There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.An internal memo from a senior VA official describes "lawlessness and chaos," at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.The memo also says they "waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws" and warns that "these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans."Even the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described "significant and chronic systemic failures," in Veterans Affairs, including "a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department," with "poor management," and "a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues." He said there is a "lack of accountability across all grade levels."Here are just a few examples:--Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.--The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.Can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?Most of those responsible have still not been held to account.Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities  and it will happen. It will be fixed.That begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality careVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.We must extend this right to all Veterans not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.This promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.We must also do more to help our Veterans find jobsEvery year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.Veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.Veterans' health care must also include the best mental health care.A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.This is a national tragedy.The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA  while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need  especially in emergencies.One of the most important reforms we can make is accountabilityRight now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.That's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.In fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.In 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.Two other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.It doesn't have to be this way.As Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: "The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is."Here is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:One:I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans  not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.Two:I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.Three:I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.Four:I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.Five:I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.Six:I will create a private White House Hotline  that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day  to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.That's a promise.Seven:We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.Eight:We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.Nine:We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.Ten:We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.Never again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.We need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do itShe is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.Crooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo  and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.Our country needs change, and she will never give us change.The fact is, she helped create our rigged system.Hillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful  and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material  which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct  followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.In fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.Afterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.When thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.If elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.Just look at what the FBI Director said about her  her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.The decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.The years of American Greatness will return.We are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.We are going to make American Great Again  And Safe Again  For All Americans.We will dream big and bold and daring things once more.Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.We will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.Thank you.
Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.  On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly. So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again. I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop. We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause] I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation. And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out. Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing. Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems. We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back. I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute. But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause] Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control. Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause] And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton. Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't. But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause] On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause] What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause] Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over. And Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause] Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money. But I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made. You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from. And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK. So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause] No, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president. Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes. But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing. But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen. They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause] So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that  delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen. And what we're doing... [applause] And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause] And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president. And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk. I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid? And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political. And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause] And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause] Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall. So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places. I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear. I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen. I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible. Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause] And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter] It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it. And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy. But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter] Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause] Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state. And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual. Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana. It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A. Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana. And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor. Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause] If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal. Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause] So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs. Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy. Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause] Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast. Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure. So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure? You know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it. But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year  but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause] And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them. So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country. The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse? So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause] So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon  and I mean very soon  come to an end.Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts:Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.The budget is no better.President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing  it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria  and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.In Libya, our consulate  the symbol of American prestige around the globe  was brought down in flames. America is far less safe  and the world is far less stable  than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.Let's defeat her in November, OK.I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment  something pointed out by Bernie Sanders  are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now  poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad  will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve. The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home  which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change  and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.I am your voice!I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.[disruption in the audience] How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws  or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence  I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was "extremely careless" and "negligent," in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it  especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders  he never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me. I will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over  at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community  no good and we're going to stop it.As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology  beleive me.And as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied  and every politician who has denied them  to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.I have made billions of dollars in business making deals  now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.Never, ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America  and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization  another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long  and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America  and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year  Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business  that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans  We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster! Thank you. Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread  one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else  all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back  bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country  to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.Remember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her". I choose to recite a different pledge.My pledge reads: "I'M WITH YOU  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."I am your voice.So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.God bless you, and good night! I love you!
Donald Trump. So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference. And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.You look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw.So you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on.Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it. Bernie Sanders never had a chance.And total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast. The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious. What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible.If I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race.With her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad.When they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse.She lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States.And I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me.She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate.So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it.They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't. They will vote it in—just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it—but she will vote.She'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side. Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period.We don't even read it, our country. Because we're led by stupid people. so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests.They're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it. The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP. And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK?So why don't we start off any questions? Yes, sir?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking.By the way, they hacked—they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked. Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it. I think he was live. But he said we think it was Russia that hacked.And then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing—and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah. Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump. He reminded me of John Lovitz for "Saturday Night Live" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes. This is the guy, you have to see it. Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.And that's why—if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total—assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.You saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.And by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years. She's been doing this for 30 years. What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change? She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists. Yes, Tom?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. None, none.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under—I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything.Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it.The Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, "Los Angeles Times", Trump 47, Clinton 40. And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton.Question. [inaudible] Putin say stay out? Why not say that?Donald Trump. Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia—which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...Question. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]?OK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are—at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up.Now, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead.So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to—literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.And I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything—it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing.Question. [inaudible] special extreme vetting?Donald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening.You look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in.Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What?I mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure.But what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants. And it's unacceptable. OK. Yes? [inaudible]Question. Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges...Donald Trump. I saw that.Question. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case.Donald Trump. Right.Question. Your reaction [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do. I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? That's my reaction. I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it. And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts.And I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal. I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out. And you had victory after victory after victory. And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first. She should prosecute herself. She should be held accountable.Question. [inaudible] to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case. Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre.Donald Trump. Well, that was a bad case to prove it. That was a bad case. I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly. But you have to get the right time. This was not one of those times. And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did. Yes ma'am?Question. So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him...Donald Trump. Yeah.Question. And [inaudible]...Donald Trump. I have a great relationship with Governor Pence. We spent the last three days together. He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press. The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11:05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept. And he accepted. And that was it. For me that was it.But right around that time you had the attack in Nice. And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day. And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible. In France. And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts. I never had a second thought in my life. It was such a lie. I mean so many lies in the press. But it was such a lie. And he has been so great. Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK? Better.Question. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?Donald Trump. I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.Go ahead.Question. What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The...Donald Trump. I would—Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything. I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy. I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain. They're not living up to the bargain. And everyone agrees with me, except for the media.And the media never says that. I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now. A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, "We are going to cover terror," they announced somebody.I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And—and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying.Question. On the Geneva Convention [inaudible].Donald Trump. Yes?Question. Do you think that they should allow for that, given the [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes.And by the way, it works.Question. [inaudible] will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...Donald Trump. I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.They just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.Excuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do—we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.No, no—yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.You know, somebody said, "but we have treaties." I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes?Question. [inaudible] how are you planning to [inaudible]?Donald Trump. We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks. I'm going to be doing a big thing on that.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community. I mean, really well. I mean, the—the poll numbers are going up very high. I think we had one recently 35 or 36. But I'm going to have a whole—we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks.So, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up. They're all way up. Biggest—they say the biggest bounce in memory. Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, "Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce." So, you know, I have to at least say.Jeremy, go ahead.Question. [inaudible] do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton?Donald Trump. I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.Right now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. OK? He mentioned the "N" word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the "N" word. You know what the "N" word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn't like him. And number two, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.Yes? Yes, sir?Question. [inaudible] relations?Donald Trump. Yes, sir.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. But let me finish with Jeremy. Go ahead.Question. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than [inaudible]?Donald Trump. President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.They're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, wait a minute.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, I'm not going to be an adversary. No, not at all. I have tenants from China. I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent. I mean, I have great relationships with China. I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder. I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent. We don't know what we're doing.I don't blame—I respect China. Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars—if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them.I have no problem with China. I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen. And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama. I think it will get worse.It's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that. But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama.Yes?Question. [off-mike] you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable.Donald Trump. That's right.Question. Working on a plan...Donald Trump. That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so.Question. Are you prepared to give us any sort of...Donald Trump. No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan. One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going—you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say.But I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people. This is such a great country, these are such great people. one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job.Number one, they get out, they have no jobs. Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place. They're not coming here. Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much.And the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their—up to their neck. They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life. They have loans.And I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it. Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher.Because college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges.Because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it. So the colleges are costing so much money. We are going to help the students. Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework.But I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it. We have to help our students. Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick.Our students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students. And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks.[crosstalk]Question. [off-mike] talking about possibly...Donald Trump. Everything's on the table, you'll see. Everything—it's a very important—it's a very important subject.Yes, ma'am?Question. Mr. Trump, [off-mike].Donald Trump. I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country. Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people.I think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it. And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment.And I think people see that. I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly—you people know because you're there—the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Because Obamacare is a disaster. In Texas, going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase. On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care. It's going to be announced on November 1st.I just asked the press, don't let him do that. Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it. It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway.In '17 unfortunately—if I'm president—I mean I've got to take over this mess. It's going to fold, anyway. But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it.They like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted. Those are the things that are resonating.And they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it.John, go ahead, John.Question. [off-mike] Russia has no business in you—that you don't have any...Donald Trump. No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.And even—for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida.Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff—I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Of course not. I own the Trump organization. Zero, zero. Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I am.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I did.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I did. Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States. But she would be so wrong. And even women say that. Women don't like her. She would be so wrong. Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster. She's been a disaster. And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter. I won't get into that.The chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard. And he left it out. Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster. I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely. But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton. Yes ma'am?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, I do.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained. I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota. I speak about it all the time. It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks. It's a real problem.You don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night. The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time. Yes, ma'am, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States. Yes, ma'am.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there. That's something really bad going on. And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it. He's still not using it. And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it. She said she will use it but so far she didn't.She'll probably use it tonight. Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace. You had a room with a massive stage without flags. I think this—I think that the people in the community know what's going on. Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people. When you look at San Bernardino, people knew—many people knew what was going on. They had bombs lying all over the floor. They had bombs on the floor. I mean, this isn't—you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor—I think there's a problem there. You got to report it.And by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK? David Hinckley was just released—John Hinckley—I think that John Hinckley—excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed. I just heard about it.[crosstalk]Question. Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia, China, anybody—to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country...Donald Trump. That's up to the President. Let the President talk to them. Look, here's the problem. Here's the problem, Katy. Katy, here's the problem, very simple. He has no respect...Question. [inaudible] 30,000 e-mails...Donald Trump. Well, they probably have them. I'd like to have them released.Question. Does that not give you pause?Donald Trump. No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well—hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton—here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.[crosstalk]Question. A question about Mike Pence, because "The New York Times" reported that [inaudible] conversation with John Kasich's campaign, [inaudible] says, you can be the most powerful [inaudible]...Donald Trump. That's the most ridiculous conversation. He never had the—Don Jr. told me—let me just tell you. Let me save you a lot of boredom.Question. [inaudible] Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected?Donald Trump. Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich. I never spoke to him about being vice president. We don't have good chemistry together. I have never spoken to him about being vice president. I would never pick him to be vice president. There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky. He never spoke—Don Jr. would never—and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point. Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy. I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous. And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy. So what's left for the president? I think you know me better than that. That was put out by him. He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine. He's fine. I would never have chosen him.Now, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people. There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job.Let me just explain—I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I. And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. It probably has. It probably has. Our government is so weak on this stuff. It probably has. Possible. I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance. I have a good system, I guess. I'm not an e- mail person, myself. I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in e-mail. A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary. But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked. Who knows?Question. [inaudible] broken the rules in traditional American politics many times. [inaudible] while the other person...Donald Trump. Yes, but my message wasn't dark. My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems. Go ahead.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. OK.Question. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week. What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet...Donald Trump. No basis. No basis.Look, John, I didn't have to do this. When I did this, believe me—you see this incredible resort. It's one of the great in the world. When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself. I don't have to be with you guys. I didn't need this. I have places that are the best in the world, OK. I could be doing other things. I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again. I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent—when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China. And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets. We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards.When I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it. You know this country's been great to me. I'm giving back. That's all.Now as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical. But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17. Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people. Wait a minute. Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing. He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner.And then I won New Hampshire. And then I won you know 38 or 39 states. And won by the way, not by a little bit. Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party. So just...Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign. But it's what I think is good. I think it's good. I think it's working here too.Question. But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns. And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were [inaudible]...Donald Trump. Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb. He used the term carpet bomb. When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that. That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me.When Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade. But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie. So I have a choice. All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter. I say to me it does matter. It matters.When people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians. But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone. In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that. Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders. And you guys know that I didn't. In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.So it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president. Today on "The Today Show" he said, this is democracy. A little bit different. Little bit different. [laughter]David, go ahead Dave.Question. Last night at the Democratic Convention [inaudible] women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage. Can you clarify your position on those?Donald Trump. You'll have to see it in the polls David. You know what my positions are. You'll have to see it at the polls.Question. I don't know what...[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yeah go ahead.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. David my positions are down. You ask the question every single time. I give you an answer. My positions are down. Take a look. Go ahead.Question. Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant—?Donald Trump. Yes I did.Question. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...Donald Trump. We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes ma'am go ahead.Question. [inaudible] President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency. Last night he said that anything is possible.Donald Trump. He did say that.Question. What is your reaction to that?Donald Trump. Well, I just said sort of said that. He just said that. He said it this morning, anything's possible. I think I'm going to win. I think people are sick and tired of incompetence. They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes. Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things. And that's why. I mean I think I'll win the election. I think you'll see that in the polls.All right a few more questions. Go ahead John.Question. Back in December...Donald Trump. I hope your arm's OK.Question. It's all right. Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership. Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip...Donald Trump. Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional. But I have great support from Israel. I will back Israel 100 percent. I would like to go there. But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel.And by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel. He has been a disaster for Israel.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't set my schedule yet. It could happen.Question. [inaudible] you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running [inaudible]?Donald Trump. No, I think we—it's possible we have. But I'm not—I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us—tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.I'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.Yes, ma'am, in the back?Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible][crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, no. Excuse me. In the back?Question. I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize [inaudible] Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are [inaudible]?Donald Trump. We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.Go ahead.Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] questions. First, a quick one on the minimum wage. You said we need to raise it to $10. [inaudible] be clear here. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?Donald Trump. Federal.Question. OK. Second question about [inaudible].Donald Trump. Right.Question. You said [inaudible]. Would religion be a part of the [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I'm not making it a part. But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part.OK.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes, ma'am? Go ahead.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. Who said that?Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. Who?Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history. His views of the world, as he says, don't jive. And the world is a mess. You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched. He has been a disaster as a president. He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country. It is a mess.And I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse.Go ahead.Question. [inaudible] polls you [inaudible]. You just said [inaudible].Donald Trump. Oh, [inaudible] just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I can't believe it. Are you Katy Turek of NBC? It's a disguise.Go ahead.[laughter]Question. Many polls show you [inaudible]. He said he feels that you are [inaudible] not prepared to be president. Can you [inaudible] lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your [inaudible]?Donald Trump. OK. Well, [inaudible].[crosstalk]Question. [inaudible] about what's going on [inaudible] and domestic affairs.Donald Trump. Sure. Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times. I've turned out to be right. I turned out to be right on NATO. After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me.Excuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals. She never said that in her life. She said it yesterday only because of me. I'm the one that's prepared. President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything. This guy didn't know a thing. And honestly, today he knows less. Today, he knows less.He's done a terrible job. I think I'm very prepared.Now, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it. I've been seeing it. I've been feeling. And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side. I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here. I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people.Question. [inaudible] advisers, though?Donald Trump. I do. I have great foreign advisers. And you have a list. And I gave you a list. And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many—we have so many. As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers.Now, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names. Look at the mess they've gotten us into. They said, "Have you spoken to so and so?" Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of. "Have you spoken to this one or that one?" I said, they were all—look at the job they've done.So a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good. Because look at the end result. The end result is our country is a mess. The Middle East has never been worse. Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an "S," gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now.All right, Tom. A couple more. Go ahead, Tom.Question. [inaudible] security briefings. You're about to get one.Donald Trump. Yeah.Question. Do you expect your opinion on [inaudible] or your opinion on [inaudible].Donald Trump. Well, we'll have to see. I mean, that's my opinion. That's my opinion. We'll have to see. I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent. It was negligent.Now why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because it's going to get revealed. I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert. And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right?I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning. So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff.I don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. No. He's not going to run for mayor. Oh, Don? He's not going to run for mayor. Don has no attention of running for mayor. But he did a great job the other night with his speech. Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor. You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio. But Don is not going to run for—he has no interest in running for mayor.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Unbelievable what he said. I think it's disgraceful. Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen. But we all know it is going to happen if she won. Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen. And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK? Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really—Anthony Weiner's—look, look, look—Anthony Weiner is a proven loser. I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room. They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out. I don't know what Anthony—my son doesn't want to run for mayor. He has no intention of running for mayor.And besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area. It's almost impossible for a Republican to win. So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed. Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, in [inaudible] very sad. Not [inaudible].Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, I'm looking at it. I actually want to find out what causes it. It's a problem in many areas, OK? Yes, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Well, they shouted—you know what was interesting. Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before. And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, "Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up." They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.Donald Trump. And I said, "Don't do that." Now, I didn't do that for any reason. I really—I didn't like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said—they started screaming "Lock her up! Lock her up." I said, "Don't do that." Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting.You do agree I said that, right?Question. You did say that.Donald Trump. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that?Question. That's what I want to ask you about, you said you...Donald Trump. No, I think it's—I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.OK, one more question, yes—yes, ma'am, go ahead.Question. Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that [inaudible] immigration.This is Doral, it was built by...Donald Trump. Well, Doral is great. And Doral—I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job.Yes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead. Yellow.Question. I have another question.Donald Trump. Excuse me. Yellow.Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate...Donald Trump. Who?Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish. Do you think this [inaudible] an advantage on...Donald Trump. No, I don't think it has any impact. He's been very bad—her running mate has been very, very bad on employment. And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad.I figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia. They don't like him. They don't like him. It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad.So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does.Thank you all very much.Question. [inaudible] running for the president [inaudible]?Donald Trump. Might as well tell him to have a good time. He has done one bad job.OK, thank you, everybody.
Thank you, everybody, thank you very much. It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism. This summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center. Last September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [applause] In Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today. France is suffering gravely. And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way. In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees. A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.Overseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.We cannot let this evil continue. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [applause] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before. But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn't want to say the words. Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [applause] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast forward to today. What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world. Iraq is in chaos. And ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.In 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that's what it was.Today they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24. And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don't even know.The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, "death to America", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour. We all remember. We all remember. [Booing] In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us.He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well.In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire. Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs. The records are unbelievable and unmistakable. His naive words were followed by even more naive actions. The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question. [applause] The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That's why we went in. With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country. The Middle East in particular. The Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation. [applause] Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face. Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [applause] It is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning. A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me.Three months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that "perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem."In August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview. Here's the quote in full. "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in. I would never have handled it that way." This was right after the invasion. "Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C'mon."I then continued, "Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have. "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing."So I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.After we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated. And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. One more point on this. I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. [applause] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil. According to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone. That's before they really got started. Fueling and funding its reign of terror. If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil. I was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen. I said, "Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it." [applause] If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war. [applause] In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [applause] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course. [applause] If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [applause] Thank you. Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. Some don't share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [applause] As president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [applause] We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. [applause] We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good.I also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause] They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.My administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding. Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records. It's got to be stopped. [applause] We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately. [applause] Unlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [applause] And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [applause] I've often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens. Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says, "Thank you."The fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al- Qaeda. And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. [applause] So important. We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.But we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important. And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them. But that will change. Just as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [applause] Our administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year. Recently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, "Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions." Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores. One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been "too Westernized." To defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It's a breeding ground. It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground. A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [applause] The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants. Clearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification. It's gotten worse, far worse. We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. Beyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [applause] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme--extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems. We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before. [applause]] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [applause] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [applause] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [applause] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [applause]Thank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. [applause] We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands . If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening. There's no way it can take place. [applause]By contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. [Boos] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. [Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters "fraud". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad. The female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fiancée visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in. A neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech. [Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. [applause]The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we "love death more then you love life". Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. [applause] Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. [applause] Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. [applause] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [applause] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.To make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [applause] But just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now. But this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But it's being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [applause] Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It's the thing he best. [applause] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart. This is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [applause] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]
It's so great to be here tonight. I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.We are at a decisive moment in this election.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness. Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives  whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore  and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?The war on our police must end. It must end now.The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.I care too much about my country to let that happen.We all care too much about our country to let that happen.Good policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.It's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.Hillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership.The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American  and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America  and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.I'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.The other party  the Democratic Party  nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past  I want to offer Americans a new future.It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting  all of us across the country are fighting  for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.I am going to give the people their voice back.Think about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?Are you ready for change?Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?Let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system  a lot of people who've created our problems  will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.It's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich.I am going to Make America Wealthy again.The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.They've ruined the schools.They've driven out the jobs.They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.Violent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.It is time for a different future.Here is what I am proposing.First, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores  and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare  which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases  and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out  as are many of the major insurance companies.On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.We are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.These are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.I will be your fighter.To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you.Most importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.The only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors  not the people.I've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: "I'm With Her"I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: "I'm With You  the American people."I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity  a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt  and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end  and it will end very quickly.Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.We cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct  it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need  and so many are not making it. They are dying.I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans  Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals  who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives  together  to save our country.I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.If something isn't working, you replace it.If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always  and I mean always  come first.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?That is all about to change  and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign  nobody else is.My only interest is the American people.So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages  openly and blatantly  just like he lied about Obamacare.Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.Let's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization  another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State  our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.But they will always come first to me.Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.Instead, I will be a champion for the people.The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed  she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.So many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.So again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice.I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again  including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for the insiders.I am fighting for you.Here is the change I propose.On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses  creating millions of new good paying jobs.We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities  and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare  at a much lower cost.On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.Finally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership  look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.What do you have to lose by trying something new?  I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.It is time to vote for a New American Future.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American proud again.We will make America safe again.Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.Thank You, and God Bless.
On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.It's going to be America First from now on.Let me tell you what this new future looks like.We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.That's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.No American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.To all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land  but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.All citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.I want every African-American parent in this country  and all parents in this country  to be able to raise their kids in safety.And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country  and all children in this country  are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.No one owns me. I answer only to the American people.In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:"The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent  down 3.2 percent.This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent  down 6.4 percent.The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014  up 1.6 percent.The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama  from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014  up 58.2 percent.Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports  down 9.5 percent."Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.We are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.That is how we are going to create a New American Future.But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.We are going to build a wall.We are going to enforce the law.We are going to protect your jobs and wages.And we are going to keep our country safe.According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.She wants catch-and-release.Obamacare for illegal immigrants.Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.She wants to gut immigration enforcement.She supports Sanctuary Cities.She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.One lawless order after another.We must not let it happen.Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.I want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.This election will decide whether or not we have a border.This election will decide whether or not we have a country.Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.These are all forgotten Americans  they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country  it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.She said she never sent or received classified materials.That was a lie, proved over and over again.She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.Another lie.Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.Another Clinton lie.She said she sent nothing marked classified.A total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.She said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.More Clinton lies.Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.One more Hillary Clinton lie.Lie after lie after lie.Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business  or, more accurately, their crime enterprise  grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation  no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday  the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.The UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.This is corruption, pure and simple.This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.Justice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.The era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.Are you ready for real American change?It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.We will promote our common culture, values and principles.We will be one nation.We will be one people.We will share together one great future.It's going to be America First.Together, we will make America proud again.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.
Thank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.I thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.The men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism  not Globalism.We are in your debt.I will never let you down.Together, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.We will be united by our common culture, values and principles  becoming One American Nation.One country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.The flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag  and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.We will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world  and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.I've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans  not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.We are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.The Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.That means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice  whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.Should I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security  and our border.I just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country  including to our Armed Services.I want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.We also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.When I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.We are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores  and unleash an American Energy Revolution.We will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy  joined by our partners in the Middle East  that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.At the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas  and use the money saved to invest in America.It is time to create a New American Future  for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.In this future, we will have an honest government  and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget  no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country  including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.We will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.We will make America Strong Again.We will Make America Proud Again.We will Make America Safe Again.We will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God bless.
It's so great to be back in Ohio.Come November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House  and we are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation. We are going to stop the foreign cheating.The era of economic surrender is over.A new era of American Greatness is beginning.No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.One bad deal after another.Hillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth  our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.I am promising a new legacy for America.We are going to create a New American Future.But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the "Gold Standard", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.We won't let that happen.We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.It's going to be America First.My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.Here are a few of the things we will do:A massive tax cut for working Americans.We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.Hillary Clinton says she wants to "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business." Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work  and we are going to get your energy bills down.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.We are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.Another major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.Last night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.Let's also talk about government corruption.No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.Here is another example of pay-for-play.In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments  including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000  his highest paying speech.In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.No one will be above the law.We will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her  and another set of rules for everyone else.I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.I am your voice.Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.My government reforms will make your voice heard  not the voice of the special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting  all of us across the country are fighting  for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity  a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make American Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless.
"Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you."Well, that's so nice. And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say. Incredible. And some spirit, some spirit. Talent."Thank you. Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways."For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me."The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important."I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that."Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy."So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone."I will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better."And I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?"Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways."Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment."Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln  a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican  has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community."I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education  so important  and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back."It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really."Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks"We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true."We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together."I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again."Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools  especially schools  and new hope."I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family."Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world  I've sort of seen a lot  to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit."When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you."Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me."We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are."Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow  and I mean that  that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity."I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true."Thank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
Thank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.In 62 days, we are going to win this state  and we are going to win the White House.This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?This is the year we can finally fix it.That's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over  your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.The change will begin my first day in office.First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.But that's just the beginning.I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes  meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.It's going to be a very busy first day.I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so  resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed  this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers  not on behalf of global corporations.We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets  and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win  and know how to keep us out of endless war.Today, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.That's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism  rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country  creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability  instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton  her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.Her conduct is disqualifying.Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter "C" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later  and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times  and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.It's called pay-for-play.One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.People are asking: where did all the money go?This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.58% of African-American youth are not working.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.This is a national crisis  and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: "No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us."Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans  and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe  which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end  and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.I'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win  and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare  as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world  just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.Hillary Clinton is just reckless  so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.She can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter "C" means confidential.If she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.Her conduct is simply disqualifying.She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is "failure." Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.Libya was stable.Syria was under control.Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States  plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.This is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.But that's not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers  their fathers flew the same plane.Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it's just 182,000.Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troopswhich would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.In the current year, we are spending $548 billion  a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts  even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks  and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition  that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.The military will not be exempt either  the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a "short-run" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies  we have 23 now.We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel  we have 276 ships now.And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions  we have 1,113 now.We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities  in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.America must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans  including in our inner cities  should get these new jobs.We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families  both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.Together, we will have one great American future.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.We will bring back our jobs.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.
Thank you. It's great to be here today.In particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.Today, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.But before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails. According to the FBI report: "The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account."Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program  among many other extremely sensitive matters.This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief. By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.Throughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.It's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times. She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn't know that the letter "C" stood for confidential classified information.All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons  not to mention the ransom payments.On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism.Last night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out  letting ISIS fill the void.But I was opposed to the war from the beginning.Long after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that "perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet," and that "the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned."Then, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is "a mess," yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.In July of 2003, I said that "I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly." I had a number of quotes to this effect.Then, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine."Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!I would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago."Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it  all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator. All talk, but nothing happened.We're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Meanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.It's time to rebuild America.Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.We are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts  our whole country hurts.My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation  African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans  will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.In order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.You can't have prosperity without security.This is the new civil rights agenda of our time. The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.It is time to break-up that monopoly.I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom  the civil right  to attend the school of their choice. This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative  with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.Let's run through the numbers.At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.The federal government pays for about 10 percent$64 billion, to be preciseof the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.New York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.Baltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.Chicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money  allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.Not only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family  not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.The current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.Failing schools then contribute to failing economies.In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.In Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.Nationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty  including 45% of children under the age of six.Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.Meanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities  which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.Government is failing our citizens at every level.That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.Here is how it will work.Right now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.Altogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.Specifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.But the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.Each state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission  to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America  Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit  that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.The money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice  and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.As your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers  instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world  that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have  or how many journalists they know  not how many Americans they help to live better lives.But the failures of the past are about to end.Those failures end beginning on November 8th.We will have One American Nation.We will be One American People.We are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.That means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.This is how we will rebuild our future.This is how We Will Make America Great Again  For Everyone.Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. [laughter] In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership. [applause] And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!MR. TRUMP: Thank you. [applause] Amazing, amazing group.One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you. [applause] All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause] True. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause] Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!MR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers]So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty  remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great  that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy. In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church  and this is all across the country  for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives  all of us. [cheers and applause]Our nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause]Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things  and these are great things  that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings  [cheers and applause]  on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment  [cheers and applause]  if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important.Thank you. That's so important.And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.And I said to them  we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue  and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.I said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems  powerful guy. I actually, as just own way  you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly  he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well  and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just  and magnificent hearts, much more importantly  they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.And that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause]When you  when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men  let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship  like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of  we're going to get rid of it so fast.And I'm so proud to say  honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud  I was just telling this to Tony  to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very  [laughter]  the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.I hope  which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot  you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.MR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have  and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up  your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  [cheers and applause]  which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period  very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives  much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause]Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community  none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years  over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing  jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause]I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time  the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause]And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents  and I say it with great respect  our inner cities are a disaster  crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause]School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition  the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause]And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent.Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children  [applause]  including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause] This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However  that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause] If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice. My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city  anybody  anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program  and there will be a lot of them  to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student. As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core  we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local. I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised  remember this, November 8th  don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause] They're starting  people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have  what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same  rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50  it's not going to change. Not going to happen. Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be  I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster. One of the most important issues, frankly  other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important  some people think it's actually the most important  is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what  how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause]This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up. Let's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty  not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably  as you know it  you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test  its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors  27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash  cash. And I actually said  they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.Think of it  $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash  massive, big vats of cash. You saw them  cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this  $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get  they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do  even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this  just another lie.But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause]At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue  can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed  have to; have no choice.To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago  different world.We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism  [cheers and applause]  words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians  very, very, very rare.So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.You ever notice on the  you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that  scenes far worse than that.So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of  oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you  [laughter]  they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe  and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause]Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today  General Flynn, who's here someplace  [cheers and applause]  I love General Flynn  but can you imagine these people saying  I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then  and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause]Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of  probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.But you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer  you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer  the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter] The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum  did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had  the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait.MR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was  honestly, I shouldn't be saying this  she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered  an unheard-of practice  hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did  [jeers]  to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough  hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter]Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it. And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through  and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country  millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause]Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you.Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause]Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that.And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily  [cheers]  something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really  that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause]We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us."AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.MR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause]Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.Change is coming.All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.It's your turn now. This is your time.The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change  not partisan change.We are fighting for all Americans  Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals  who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first  and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership  are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton  much of it to her personal bank account  to keep you from having the future you deserve.But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too  without any plan for the day after.She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength  not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world  so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.America will get the respect it deserves.And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace  for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change  but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win  and how to avoid endless war.Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States  not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.That applies to everything.Change is needed at every single level of our society.When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.The possibilities for our future are unlimited.The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist  now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone  but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans  from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice  and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.Massive tax reductions and tax simplification  so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.Once again, we will be One American Nation.We Will Be One American People.Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!
This is our chance  our one chance  to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.All of these reform plans are available on our website.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.Above all else, you are Americans  and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.We've released policy after policy, solution after solution.Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restriction on American energy  this will create another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization  another Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.She even made her 13 different phones disappear  some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family in Haiti.Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law.She also believes that she is above all of you.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a "basket of deplorables." She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options  what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them  she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.She called these Americans every name in the book  racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic  she said they were not even American.Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better  and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration  and that have been dismissed by my opponent  are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.We must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers.The scandals never seem to end  but they will, when I'm elected President.Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.We are on a mission of change.That includes a new agenda for our inner cities.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.For those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans  and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe  which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end.Honesty will be restored.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.And will Make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. I am honored to be here today. Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you.The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.Our debt to you is eternal.Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas  including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.If I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down.I am running to be a President for all Americans  and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.They embody the goodness and decency of our country.I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book  she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.She called them a "basket of deplorables" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.Hillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.To this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East  or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.I am running to be your voice.Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all  she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.Let's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks  it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook  smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.We are the campaign of school choice.We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do  and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.You are there to respond to every natural disaster.You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.In a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.You will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.We will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.Our gratitude is everlasting.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow your example of unity  working in common purpose and common cause.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.We will rebuild our military  and our country.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless you all.
Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.Our campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense  even more than housing.Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area  and my opponent has no childcare plan.Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster  a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America  including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians  to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributionsto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax  a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans  you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year  they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover  so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reformsI outlined last week.The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds  if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button  including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together  not as Republicans or Democrats  but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, loveyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.It is time to Believe In America.Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.
Thank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.The White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow  and they will grow rapidly.This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another  on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.I am running to be a President for all Americans  Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear  including with a hammer  so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs  here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: "she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the officefrom the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true."The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.That includes our family farms right here in Iowa.Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death  helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy  which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the "lack of transparency," was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about  and I quote  "the stupidity of the American voter." This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton  and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose  vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.I will make your communities safe.Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden  and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.In all things, it's time to put Americans first  and start taking care of each other.Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA  which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States  not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again  like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.The people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970  today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs  safety, security, opportunity.Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes  we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.I am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else  and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.The economic policies of Hillary Clinton  on trade, on the economy, on immigration  have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.Hillary Clinton believes in globalism  taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world  I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change  it's time to vote for America and America First.Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East  in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.One failure after another  all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That begins with a new America-First trade policy.Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP  she called it the "Gold Standard."Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved  which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.We won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.In all things, it's time to put Americans first  and start taking care of each other.Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA  which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States  not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again  like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival  it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM  today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around.My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism  which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country  and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution  a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable  how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos  but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States  and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.It's time to start thinking big once again.That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter  that translates to millions of lost jobs.This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt  it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.Never has so much money been spent so poorly.But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.It begins with bold new tax reform.As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all  in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit  it won't even be close.This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit  in the form a Childcare rebate  and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate  down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs  and that means jobs in our poorest communities.Next, comes regulations.One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry  and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.Energy reform is central to our plan as wellAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama  creating countless more jobs in the process.Finally, comes trade  the foundation for everythingAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year  an enormous drag on growth.Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted  every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators  and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.Here is how the plan adds upWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade  again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.This is what our new future will look likeI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA  and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country  including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people  it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic  but above all else, you are American.Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers  as well as law enforcement officers across the country.And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book  and Americans have had enough.They want solutions, and they want better lives  not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.That future begins with prosperity at home.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress  and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years  her disastrous record speaks for itself.The only people she delivers for is her donors.I am going to deliver for you, the American people.If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy  which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them  and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.Let's also talk about Venezuela.Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives  and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims.I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will.I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.You are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.It's happening every single day.All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?What do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?What do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?This must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.Just look at what's happened in the last few days.Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.Earlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported  but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach  the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch  she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.Now, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain.She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order  violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.But the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody  or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.Your cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.But help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.Together, we will save American lives  and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities  these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.According to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.At the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.Whether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger  they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.Let's just remember our goal  to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.That is what is at stake in this election.So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK]These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer.I am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.
Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to cut your taxes.We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.Attack after attack  from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando  we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term  with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day  and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign  many of them cops and soldiers  deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty  where is Hillary's condemnation here?Let's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable  or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values  and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.It's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies  these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides "aid and comfort," to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger  just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today  and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.We must stop the massive inflow of refugees  which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion  such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith are commonplace.It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.It is time to have a new American Future.We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.We are going to rebuild our country.And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it  I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.My whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs  just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs  instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal  and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year  this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.But we are going to turn it all around.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.Great polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.We are going to Make America Safe Again.The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.Who is looking out for them?For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.But to do this, we must work with our police  not against our police.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.The problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city  it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.Who is there to represent these families?Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change  it's time for a New American Future.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children." Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say."At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.This will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries  we are going to bring them back.Jobs will come flowing back in all over America.It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We're going to turn it all around.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign  and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you  visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.Let me tell you what else we're going to do.One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.But they should be using the money on the students  for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college  but to increase it.We have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars  paid for by you  that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.Another major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened  the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.Just one more Washington lie  like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.It's a disaster.That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens  bankrupting these programs for Americans.She doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that  they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America  and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity  where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses  I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be  all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers  and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 46 days to change the world. You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.

Good morning. Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.Let me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.It is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times  but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country  and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.We all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer  and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates  and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas  hunted down for execution  continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.In addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.This brings us to the subject of energy.Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again  especially for the poorest Americans.America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy  some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.It's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities  including right here in Pennsylvania.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama  creating countless more jobs in the process.Overall, my entire economic plan  tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform  will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today  turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut  including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.Compare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.According to the Wall Street Journal, "Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo."Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.The platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a "price on carbon." That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production  a tax on American consumers.And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country  often foreign countries not very friendly to us.That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.We need an America-First energy plan.This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions  more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production  which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.That means we will end the war on coal.I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.We will eliminate the highly-invasive "Waters of the US" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.We Will make America Wealthy Again.We Will make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees.Tremendous polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media  we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.We will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.We will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs. The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor  we will remove those restrictions day one.We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.President Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.Our replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market  they will be competing for your business.We're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks. High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.On trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.Our massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class  and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders. There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.Hillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.I am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children."Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say."At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.And just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.Families can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.We have also talked about improving education. My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.We are also going to bring down the cost of college.Universities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments  but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students. I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt. This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work. Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.By the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.We are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.Another major part of our agenda is safety.I believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.Today, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.African-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.Many African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.At the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.I will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.That includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice.Democrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.The jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.To those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.The policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities  just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.Of course, she got rich through it all  the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.Worst of all, she put her public office up for sale  and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign  and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment.They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America  and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity  where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses  I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be  all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers  and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. We'll turn it all around.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 44 days until the big vote. You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration  and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.And we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Hillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her."I have a different pledge: I'm With You  the American People.To all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends  including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad.We are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.On November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.Lower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.I am an outsider fighting for you.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton  or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks. She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.We can't let that happen. That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.The Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country.The American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.How many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past. We are the bright future.While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.Never in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.It's time for real change  a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators."Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?Why can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want? Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?The answer is simple. Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.Look at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.She failed upstate New York.She failed the inner cities.She's failed women and children. I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.And she has been a disaster on our borders.I'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities. Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Just Follow The Money.Her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.That includes keeping your family safe.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.I will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations  including on our farmers  negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child  including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Remember: Follow the Money.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.An article in the New York Post was published recently called "How Donald Trump helped save New York City."The article said, quote: "Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out Trump  almost by force of will  rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead."That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th  and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is so important.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.

Thank you. It's so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll  and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.I am an outsider fighting for you.One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.This is a national crisis.Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters  many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters  deplorable and irredeemable.Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of "implicit bias,"  essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as "super-predators."How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.The police officers she attacks are the same people  of all colors and nationalities  who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives.The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.I will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities.The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change.Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.The inner cities have been left behind.Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton  or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.This will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Look at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS  in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.She failed upstate New York  promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.She failed the inner cities.She's failed women and children.The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.I'm not owned or controlled by anyone  my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child  including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.Follow the Money.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.Government will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th  and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.You have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.Don't let it slip away. Don't let this chance go. Stand up and be heard  for your family, for your city, for your country.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.I've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for you.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.Again, just follow the money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country.The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.The Clintons are the sordid past.We are the bright future.While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators."Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.We will unleash the power of American energy  we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton  and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership  which would destroy manufacturing in this state.Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?Think about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?All the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.The reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.That includes keeping your family safe.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.The failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.We will never back down from fighting to save American lives.That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled  once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border  that is a promise.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
I am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.In 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.It is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.We are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity  a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a depleted military.It is time to rebuild Detroit. It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich  by taking your jobs and your money away from you.That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the "Gold Standard." The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP  and their wish is her command.These special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.On November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for you.Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.We are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.We have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.They don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.These Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.For decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem  and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.In their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change.Now, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?No one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton.Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country.Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators."To the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.We will unleash the power of American energy.The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated  and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO  both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico.It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal "will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive." She pledged to reject the deal.But she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.Once installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a "cutting-edge deal." She rammed it through to adoption  she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.The U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a "global community of stakeholders."Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a "global community." It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?The reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars  made in Michigan  will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.To the people of Michigan, I promise you this We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!
This is such an amazing city. It's called "Home of the Heroes," because of your proud tradition of military service. Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients. As President Eisenhower said, there must be "something in the water out there in Pueblo" because "all you guys turn out to be heroes."Colorado is home to six military bases. We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military.Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment.One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas. We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work.I have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan and the largest regulatory reform in American history. That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.Along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.I've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.It is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws  all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.It's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.Many so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time  despite being a beneficiary.I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them  and that is what I commit to doing.As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.I have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required  or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.As a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes. It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible  which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities  and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.The conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically  and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.Many business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost  and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.Yet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.That did not happen by chance or luck  it happened by action, and talent.I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did. In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.Those who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties. People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling government favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life  or added a single dollar of value to the American economy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life  all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors  for astronomical dollars and like never before. It's corruption of the highest order.While I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.By her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars  without building a company, or creating a single thing of value. During the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back. They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.But, I never had any doubts and never gave up.That's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best. And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.Just look at what happened in the primary. Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.The reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight. That's what I am  a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.With my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.That is why I am here today. That is why I have left private business for public life  because I understand our country is in very bad shape. And now our country is in need of a major comeback  it needs one now more than ever.We owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story  we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.Our country is broke.We have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a monthly basis.This is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children. And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around  starting today.What I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.We cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.We can turn this all around  but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW. The failed political establishment must go  it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.In the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished. Everybody said that I was done  there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.So they said I was finished. The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.I started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company. When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same  but the value of the assets plummeted. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.My understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.Now, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.The early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.These are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.These tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess  but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win. That's the thinking we need for our country  that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.Put me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you. Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors. I am here fighting for America.Many people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen  I've proven that over and over again.That's what I do. When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done  that's when I am just getting started.The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point.From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.On November 8th, America's comeback begins  and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.The people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.This is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state. Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans.And, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American. Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.This is the change I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home. She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.She opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools. We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it  Obamacare is an absolute disaster. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent  the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization  and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the "Gold Standard."Colorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.But while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.To hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.We have become a Banana Republic.Now, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Let me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it  by showing up and voting on November 8th.People have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.This is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.The Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future.Now, another issue I want to address today is immigration. As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants. It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.Illegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs  including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.We are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.We are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.Cases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.Or cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama  and then released again after the killing.There are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out  and we are going to get them out quickly.To the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.We also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington.Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.Terrorists are infiltrating our country.Now, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the Middle East.I want to keep you and your family safe.My job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America  putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.If you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.Immigration Security is National Security.Here are some more things we will do starting in 2017 We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We are going to rebuild America.We are going to revitalize America.And we are going to unite America.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.Together, we will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!
It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services.Before we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.To truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.As President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.Cyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way. The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter "C" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.Just consider some of these recent hacks:JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.Identify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware  involving the extortion of a hacked institution  are all becoming increasingly common.Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.As President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability  no matter how difficult  to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.
Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.In 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.I am going to make America Rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change  she is four more years of Obama.Clinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse  she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.I know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.I know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.I've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.We are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs  or certainly not the jobs they want.Overseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.America needs a turnaround.America needs a comeback.America needs a change.That is why I am running.First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.The architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie  he called it the "stupidity of the American voter." But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.Do you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.He has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country."Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said:He just said it's a "crazy system," where people end up with "premiums doubled and coverage cut in half." He said "it's the craziest thing in the world."Bill Clinton said:"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfthe people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work."I couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.This is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.There is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.Next, we are going to unleash American energyI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Companies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.A nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.A country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.A government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.In California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17  he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer  but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now  when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington.Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.Hillary is for open borders.I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end  beginning in January of 2017.We are going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.We have become a Banana Republic.Yesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it  by sending in your ballots.We are also going to fix our inner cities45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.To everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?We will have safe communities for EVERYONE.School choice for your children.Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.Everyone will be included in the American Dream.Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We are going to rebuild America.We are going to revitalize America.And we are going to unite America.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.You're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.You are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.It's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.All together, we are going to Make America wealthy again.We are going to make America strong again.We are going to make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you. It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada  a state where I have so many great friends and employees.In 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?Mike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse  she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction  she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.I am running to represent Americans  and we are going to make America Rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.Our police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported  and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.We are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs  or certainly not the jobs they want.Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.America needs a turnaround.America needs a comeback.America needs a change.That is why I am running.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back  bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.That was a lie.He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.Another lie.Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country."Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said:He just said it's a "crazy system," and that "it's the craziest thing in the world."Bill said:"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfthe people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work."On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the "Gold Standard." The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for YOU.We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.America will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.In California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17  he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely  when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today  and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this  they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence.The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.Hillary is for open borders.I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens  your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.We are also going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.I want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.

Thank you. I am so thrilled to be here in RenoWith your help, in 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back our jobs.We are going to make America rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.

The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.With your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada. Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.But to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals  and stand up to countries that cheat.China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.The jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country. I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country  and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.It's going to be a new day in America.For too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.Thousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.In fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.But she didn't do it.The ICE officers, who endorsed me  their first endorsement of a candidate ever  issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.Let me read from it.Again, this all a quote from the ICE officers: "Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.""Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders."Their quote continues."She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees."The ICE officers conclude by saying: "Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders."That whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States  anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely  when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington State.The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We are also going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.It's worse than Watergate.Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more.

I will fix it.I will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities.I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.

The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation.Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena  and then destroyed her phones with a hammer  all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations....Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed "serious concerns" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from "Friends of Bill" or "William Jefferson Clinton VIPs" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.People who were labeled "Not Friends of Bill" were placed on the sidelines.In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.The company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.Today, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.To all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.I'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.The emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.To all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and  as confirmed by Wikileaks  she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security....Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged.Reporters who work for these outlets  like the Washington Post, or the New York Times  may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.The emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption.The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: "from time to time I get the questions in advance."The media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people....On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.I am asking all Americans  Republicans, Independents and Democrats  to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you.I am so happy to be back here in Columbus. Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same.We are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.And we've only begun to fight.If we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.We are the campaign of change.We will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.I've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter.So they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations  but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.In an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.I want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.Right now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.The greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same  they collaborate and conspire together.This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.These are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.These are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.These are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.These are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.These are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.The political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.At the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors  including foreign government and foreign actors.Hillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.She ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans  and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.She defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim  and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for "open borders." That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures  she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.We won't let it happen.Hillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.Under a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.Under President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.The new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.Yet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.The share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.In a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.First, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.Tuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.In all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.Students should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.That is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.That's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.Every American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.In addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.Some schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.We want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.Much of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.Federal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.As president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.I will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.We will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.We also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.I will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.There is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance optionseach of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.We also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing  jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.We will protect these jobs for Americans.My economic plan  including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms  will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.This includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.Finally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.Together, we are going to make America great again.
Thank you, it is so great to be here in Florida.In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago  and yet they are working harder.It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan  and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before  and we won't let them do that.The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.For them, it is a war  and for them, nothing is out of bounds.This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.The Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine  including 2,000 more emails this morningThese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.What's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine  and that magazine should be put out of business.Six months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it  just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago  another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.Also, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election.This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony  the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.This weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.This is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.But let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime  indeed one the most important elections in modern history  and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.So now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed  in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.But I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.Our political establishment has no soul.I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States  in the back of her airplane, while on the runway  for 39 minutes  to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more  and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.I didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else  and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right  and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future  but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person  which is what our country needs  will ever again run for this office.I will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.But I also know, it's not about me  it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country.It's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.We will vote for the country we want.We will vote for the future we want.We will vote for the politics we want.We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country  and the disenfranchisement of our people.Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.
Thank you.In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency  and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional Subpoena  she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you  we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.We have to solve this crisis.I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, FiatChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.We are going to start making things in America again.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.We will lower taxes massively on all Americans  Hillary will raise your taxes massively.We will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you.In 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House.Make sure to get your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.We are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs  her private position  then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud.Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional Subpoena  she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen.We have only just begun to fight.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head  after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.A wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.But, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.When I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again.We'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.We are going to start making things in America again.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will lower taxes massively on all Americans  Hillary will raise your taxes massively. Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class  this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.Reagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms  on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy  will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.President Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new "National Monument." No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.But we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors.I'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable  and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America powerful again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.
Thank you.In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.This is a criminal conspiracy  a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.But it gets even worse.The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a "quid pro quo." This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.This is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.But there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, "take the money!!" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.Remember, we are competing in a rigged election  the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved  Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.The following comes straight from Pew Research.QUOTE: "Approximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate."QUOTE: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters."QUOTE: "Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state."Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: "could non-citizens decide the November election?" Here are some excerpts.QUOTE: "More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote."QUOTE: "Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin."Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.We will not let that happen.It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do  he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.So, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.The list goes on and on.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are "Un-American."So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.The ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:--Support for Sanctuary Cities--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens--Obamacare for illegal immigrants--No deportation of visa overstays--Expanding catch-and-release on the border--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives--A 550% increase in Syrian refugeesEither we win this election, or we lose the country.Under a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election  if I win!ALTERNATE:Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept  without delay or hesitation  the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.Now, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.The question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.John Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.A campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.And a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies  is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.In addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile  who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race  she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question  he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.So it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead  which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.So what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.But, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.Right now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests  Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following:A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.It's about time.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization  two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.It's going to be America First.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.If I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.We are going to save American lives.Either we win this election, or we lose the country.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Because if we win We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.In 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration.We will be a strong nation again. American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia.Strength will also require growth.Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries  including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's how our system is corrupt and broken.We're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile  who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.Hillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question  a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance  more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following:A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, JobsAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.We are going to start making things in America again  and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office. It will report to what we call the American Desk. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.It's going to be America First.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can.If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported  but never was.What kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?Either we win this election, or we lose the country.A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.You're going to remember this day.This is a movement like you've never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the mostimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Because if we win We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.In 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.But you have to vote on November 8th.Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns  raised from special interests  and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.We will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years  but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.We're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed "structurally deficient."We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania  shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: "Trenton Makes, The World Takes."Under a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again  and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.She's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional subpoena  lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer  and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance  more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.We're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations  the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.We will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.She even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported  but never was.If I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported. And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.Either we win this election, or we lose the country.A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.For the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day.This is a movement like you've never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.If we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.It's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.In 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.Early voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.Yesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter  a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.So I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America  because we are all just One America.It's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.And my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.Next, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia  she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal  and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more  including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.In the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding "many billions," in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.The humiliation for our country never seems to end  and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer  and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat  she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.The Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.When I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.If you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan.This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.My proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.With a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years  and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.We will start making things in America.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.Immigration security is national security.Hillary's pledge for "open borders" includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America  including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas "approved" on the way in.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.All across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.Kate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before.90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.Laura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned.The examples go on and on and on.Under a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.That includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.With a victory in November, everything will change.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 16 days to make this all happen  but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.It will be a government of, by and for the people.For those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.I'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. This is a movement like the world has never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me.That is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists  I work for you, and only you.Our campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything  she's just made it worse.American politics is caught in a time loop  we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent  and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent  which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact "open borders,"  made in secret to a foreign bank  would destroy the African-American middle class.At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home  meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession  through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.Then there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules  not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI  put our national security at grave risk  and not even face so much as a fine.Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.We will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal  but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.On immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.Infrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.School choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.This is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering  imagine if that money had been spent at home.My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system  premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.Now is the time to embrace a New Direction.I've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.Enough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach.Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path  we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.
Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure.She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.To further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.She even pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified.As the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit.The Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in.The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before  including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street.Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.Hillary should have been convicted long ago.That the legal process has been taking this long is incredible.And now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI  that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her.97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General.Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona.He said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees.This is what we mean when we call it a rigged system.Now the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right  but what should have been done many months ago.Perhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach.The stakes on November 8th could not be higher.A vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system.What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws  Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle.Public Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy.Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself.If the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government.It deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation.Corruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system.When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They detach. Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority.Hillary believes money and power  not truth and justice  should rule the day.As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.This is what we often see in Third World countries  where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment.Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.We must save the America.That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.
The silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.It's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.Every single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said "the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable."Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the "stupidity of the American voter."Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure  and exposure.She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. But she didn't care  as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.To cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators  whoever offers the highest price.Yet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI  that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws  Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope  they stop dreaming, they stop trying.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.Hillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.As FDR once said, "government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob."Hillary believes money and power  not truth and justice  should rule the day.We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.Look at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.Her policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.A Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We will become a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.These were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.Hillary has pledged "open borders," and supports Sanctuary Cities.Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported  but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother.28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.His illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.When I become President, this crime wave ends.We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.We will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need  fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence  that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft  they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing  she's just made things worse.She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests.We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.With your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.Together, We Will Make America JUST Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. [applause]Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. [applause]Thank you very much. [applause]I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. [applause]She congratulated us — it's about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard.Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. [applause]I mean that very sincerely. [applause]Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. [applause]It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. [applause]For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people...[laughter]...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. [applause]As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. [applause]It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. [applause]Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. [applause]Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [applause]We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.We will also finally take care of our great veterans. [applause]They've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. [applause]We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. [applause]We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. [applause]We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. [applause]Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? [applause]My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. [applause]Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.To Melania and Don...[applause]...and Ivanka...[applause]...and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. [applause]This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been — it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. [applause]Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. [applause]Thank you, Chris.The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? [applause]Great man.Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? [laughter]Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? [applause]Where is Ben?And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much.General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? [applause]And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.A very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is...[crosstalk]That's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, "They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win," because you can't be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.But I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. [applause]Boy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. [applause]Say a few words. No, come on, say something.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. [applause]Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.The President-elect: We will do a great job. [applause]I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... [applause]...you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can...[crosstalk]Thank you very much.And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. [applause]We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you. [applause]
﻿FLORENCE AND DANTE.


Dante is himself the hero of the _Divine Comedy_, and ere many stages of
the _Inferno_ have been passed the reader feels that all his steps are
being taken in a familiar companionship. When every allowance has been
made for what the exigencies of art required him to heighten or
suppress, it is still impossible not to be convinced that the author is
revealing himself much as he really was--in some of his weakness as well
as in all his strength. The poem itself, by many an unconscious touch,
does for his moral portraiture what the pencil of Giotto has done for
the features of his face. The one likeness answers marvellously to the
other; and, together, they have helped the world to recognise in him the
great example of a man of genius who, though at first sight he may seem
to be austere, is soon found to attract our love by the depth of his
feelings as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of his fancy,
and by the clearness of his judgment on everything concerned with the
lives and destiny of men. His other writings in greater or less degree
confirm the impression of Dante's character to be obtained from the
_Comedy_. Some of them are partly autobiographical; and, studying as a
whole all that is left to us of him, we can gain a general notion of
the nature of his career--when he was born and what was his condition in
life; his early loves and friendships; his studies, military service,
and political aims; his hopes and illusions, and the weary purgatory of
his exile.

To the knowledge of Dante's life and character which is thus to be
acquired, the formal biographies of him have but little to add that is
both trustworthy and of value. Something of course there is in the
traditional story of his life that has come down from his time with the
seal of genuineness; and something that has been ascertained by careful
research among Florentine and other documents. But when all that old and
modern _Lives_ have to tell us has been sifted, the additional facts
regarding him are found to be but few; such at least as are beyond
dispute. Boccaccio, his earliest biographer, swells out his _Life_, as
the earlier commentators on the _Comedy_ do their notes, with what are
plainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied by Dante's own
words; while more recent and critical writers succeed with infinite
pains in little beyond establishing, each to his own satisfaction, what
was the order of publication of the poet's works, where he may have
travelled to, and when and for how long a time he may have had this or
that great lord for a patron.

A very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the events of Dante's
life as far as they are certainly known. But, to be of use as an
introduction to the study of his great poem, any biographical sketch
must contain some account--more or less full--of Florentine affairs
before and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these are to be
found many of the persons of the _Comedy_. In reading the poem we are
never suffered for long to forget his exile. From one point of view it
is an appeal to future ages from Florentine injustice and ingratitude;
from another, it is a long and passionate plea with his native town to
shake her in her stubborn cruelty. In spite of the worst she can do
against him he remains no less her son. In the early copies of it, the
_Comedy_ is well described as the work of Dante Alighieri, the
Florentine; since not only does he people the other world by preference
with Florentines, but it is to Florence that, even when his words are
bitter against her, his heart is always feeling back. Among the glories
of Paradise he loves to let his memory rest on the church in which he
was baptized and the streets he used to tread. He takes pleasure in her
stones; and with her towers and palaces Florence stands for the
unchanging background to the changing scenes of his mystical pilgrimage.

The history of Florence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
agrees in general outline with that of most of its neighbours. At the
beginning of the period it was a place of but little importance, ranking
far below Pisa both in wealth and political influence. Though retaining
the names and forms of municipal government, inherited from early times,
it was in reality possessed of no effective control over its own
affairs, and was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely as
was ever any German village planted in the shadow of a castle. To
Florence, as to many a city of Northern and Central Italy, the first
opportunity of winning freedom came with the contest between Emperor
and Pope in the time of Hildebrand. In this quarrel the Church found its
best ally in Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. She, to secure the goodwill
of her subjects as against the Emperor, yielded first one and then
another of her rights in Florence, generally by way of a pious gift--an
endowment for a religious house or an increase of jurisdiction to the
bishop--these concessions, however veiled, being in effect so many
additions to the resources and liberties of the townsmen. She made Rome
her heir, and then Florence was able to play off the Papal against the
Imperial claims, yielding a kind of barren homage to both Emperor and
Pope, and only studious to complete a virtual independence of both.
Florence had been Matilda's favourite place of residence; and,
benefiting largely as it did by her easy rule, it is no wonder that her
name should have been cherished by the Florentines for ages after as a
household word.[1] Nor is the greatest Florentine unmindful of her. Foe
of the Empire though she was, he only remembers her piety; and it is by
Matilda, as representing the active religious life, that Dante is
ushered into the presence of Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.[2]

It was a true instinct which led Florence and other cities to side
rather with the Pope than with the Emperor in the long-continued
struggle between them for predominance in Italy. With the Pope for
overlord they would at least have a master who was an Italian, and one
who, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest be led to
treat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent triumph of the
Emperor, Italy must have become subject and tributary to Germany, and
would have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for members
of the German garrison. The danger was brought home to many of the
youthful commonwealths during the eventful reign of Frederick Barbarossa
(1152-1190). Strong in Germany beyond most of his predecessors, that
monarch ascended the throne with high prerogative views, in which he was
confirmed by the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians.
According to these there could be only one master in the world; as far
as regarded the things of time, but one source of authority in
Christendom. They maintained everything to be the Emperor's that he
chose to take. When he descended into Italy to enforce his claims, the
cities of the Lombard League met him in open battle. Those of Tuscany,
and especially Florence, bent before the blast, temporising as long as
they were able, and making the best terms they could when the choice lay
between submission and open revolt. Even Florence, it is true, strong in
her allies, did once take arms against an Imperial lieutenant; but as a
rule she never refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in fact
beyond what could not be helped. In her pursuit of advantages,
skilfully using every opportunity, and steadfast of aim even when most
she appeared to waver, she displayed something of the same address that
was long to be noted as a trait in the character of the individual
Florentine.

The storm was weathered, although not wholly without loss. When, towards
the close of his life, and after he had broken his strength against the
obstinate patriotism of Lombardy, Frederick visited Florence in 1185, it
was as a master justly displeased with servants who, while they had not
openly rebelled against him, had yet proved eminently unprofitable, and
whom he was concerned to punish if not to destroy. On the complaint of
the neighbouring nobles, that they were oppressed and had been plundered
by the city, he gave orders for the restoration to them of their lands
and castles. This accomplished, all the territory left to Florence was a
narrow belt around the walls. Villani even says that for the four years
during which Frederick still lived the Commonwealth was wholly landless.
And here, rather than lose ourselves among the endless treaties,
leagues, and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles, it
may be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution of Florentine
society, and especially at the place held in it by the class which found
its protector in Barbarossa.

Much about the time at which the Commonwealth was relieved of its feudal
trammels, as a result of the favour or the necessities of Matilda, it
was beginning to extend its commerce and increase its industry. Starting
somewhat late on the career on which Venice, Genoa, and Pisa were
already far advanced, Florence was as if strenuous to make up for lost
time, and soon displayed a rare comprehension of the nature of the
enterprise. It may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,
there has been anywhere so clear an understanding of the truth that
public wellbeing is the sum of private prosperity, or such an
enlightened perception of what tends to economical progress. Florence
had no special command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-port
of her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural genius of her people.
She could therefore thrive only by dint of holding open her
communications with the world at large, and grudged no pains either of
war or diplomacy to keep at Pisa a free way out and in for her
merchandise. Already in the twelfth century she received through that
port the rough woollens of Flanders, which, after being skilfully
dressed and dyed, were sent out at great profit to every market of
Europe. At a somewhat later period the Florentines were to give as
strong a proof of their financial capacity as this was of their
industrial. It was they who first conducted a large business in bills of
exchange, and who first struck a gold coin which, being kept of
invariable purity, passed current in every land where men bought and
sold--even in countries where the very name of Florence was unknown.[3]

In a community thus devoted to industry and commerce, it was natural
that a great place should be filled by merchants. These were divided
into six guilds, the members of which, with the notaries and lawyers,
who composed a seventh, formed the true body of the citizens.
Originally the consuls of these guilds were the only elected officials
in the city, and in the early days of its liberty they were even charged
with political duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty of
peace with a neighbouring state. In the fully developed commune it was
only the wealthier citizens--the members, we may assume, of these
guilds--who, along with the nobles,[4] were eligible for and had the
right of electing to the public offices. Below them was the great body
of the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged in the
meaner kinds of business. From one point of view, the liberties of the
citizens were only their privileges. But although the labourers and
humbler tradesmen were without franchises, their interests were not
therefore neglected, being bound up with those of the one or two
thousand citizens who shared with the patricians the control of public
affairs.

There were two classes of nobles with whom Florence had to reckon as she
awoke to life--those within the walls, and those settled in the
neighbouring country. In later times it was a favourite boast among the
noble citizens--a boast indulged in by Dante--that they were descended
from ancient Roman settlers on the banks of the Arno. A safer boast
would in many cases have been that their ancestors had come to Italy in
the train of Otho and other conquering Emperors. Though settled in the
city, in some cases for generations, the patrician families were not
altogether of it, being distinguished from the other citizens, if not
always by the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least by
their delight in war and contempt for honest industry. But with the
faults of a noble class they had many of its good qualities. Of these
the Republic suffered them to make full proof, allowing them to lead in
war and hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.

Like the city itself, the nobles in the country around had been feudally
subject to the Marquis of Tuscany. After Matilda's death they claimed to
hold direct from the Empire; which meant in practice to be above all
law. They exercised absolute jurisdiction over their serfs and
dependants, and, when favoured by the situation of their castles, took
toll, like the robber barons of Germany, of the goods which passed
beneath their walls. Already they had proved to be thorns in the side of
the industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the twelfth century
their neighbourhood became intolerable, and for a couple of generations
the chief political work of Florence was to bring them to reason. Those
whose lands came up almost to the city gates were first dealt with, and
then in a widening circle the country was cleared of the pest. Year
after year, when the days were lengthening out in spring, the roughly
organised city militia was mustered, war was declared against some
specially obnoxious noble and his fortress was taken by surprise, or,
failing that, was subjected to a siege. In the absence of a more
definite grievance, it was enough to declare his castle dangerously near
the city. These expeditions were led by the nobles who were already
citizens, while the country neighbours of the victim looked on with
indifference, or even helped to waste the lands or force the stronghold
of a rival. The castle once taken, it was either levelled with the
ground, or was restored to the owner on condition of his yielding
service to the Republic. And, both by way of securing a hold upon an
unwilling vassal and of adding a wealthy house and some strong arms to
the Commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family, to reside in
Florence for a great part of every year.

With a wider territory and an increasing commerce, it was natural for
Florence to assume more and more the attitude of a sovereign state,
ready, when need was, to impose its will upon its neighbours, or to join
with them for the common defence of Tuscany. In the noble class and its
retainers, recruited as has been described, it was possessed of a
standing army which, whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,
was never so well pleased as when in active employment. Not that the
commons left the fighting wholly to the men of family, for they too, at
the summons of the war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the best
they did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professional
men-at-arms, they must have failed more frequently in their enterprises,
or at any rate have had to endure a greatly prolonged absence from their
counters and workshops. And yet, esteem this advantage as highly as we
will, Florence surely lost more than it gained by compelling the crowd
of idle gentlemen to come within its walls. In the course of time some
of them indeed condescended to engage in trade--sank, as the phrase
went, into the ranks of the _Popolani_, or mere wealthy citizens; but
the great body of them, while their landed property was being largely
increased in value in consequence of the general prosperity, held
themselves haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form. Each
family, or rather each clan of them, lived apart in its own group of
houses, from among which towers shot aloft for scores of yards into the
air, dominating the humbler dwellings of the common burghers. These,
whenever they came to the front for a time in the government, were used
to decree that all private towers were to be lopped down to within a
certain distance from the ground.

It is a favourite exercise of Villani and other historians to trace the
troubles and revolutions in the state of Florence to chance quarrels
between noble families, arising from an angry word or a broken troth.
Here, they tell, was sown the seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline wars in
Florence; and here that of the feuds of Black and White. Such quarrels
and party names were symptoms and nothing more. The enduring source of
trouble was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,
constantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost, and to secure
itself by every available means, including that of outside help, in the
possession of what it still retained; which chafed against the curbs put
upon its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed to the
general interest. The citizens, for their part, had nothing better to
hope for than that Italy should be left to the Italians, Florence to the
Florentines. On the occasion of the celebrated Buondelmonti feud (1215),
some of the nobles definitely went over to the side of the people,
either because they judged it likely to win in the long-run, or
impelled unconsciously by the forces that in every society divide
ambitious men into two camps, and in one form or another develop party
strife. They who made a profession of popular sympathy did it with a
view of using rather than of helping the people at large. Both of the
noble parties held the same end in sight--control of the Commonwealth;
and this would be worth the more the fewer there were to share it. The
faction irreconcilable with the Republic on any terms included many of
the oldest and proudest houses. Their hope lay in the advent of a strong
Emperor, who should depute to them his rights over the money-getting,
low-born crowd.


II.

The opportunity of this class might seem to have come when the
Hohenstaufen Frederick II., grandson of Barbarossa, ascended the throne,
and still more when, on attaining full age, he claimed the whole of the
Peninsula as his family inheritance. Other Emperors had withstood the
Papal claims, but none had ever proved an antagonist like Frederick. His
quarrel seemed indeed to be with the Church itself, with its doctrines
and morals as well as with the ambition of churchmen; and he offered the
strange spectacle of a Roman Emperor--one of the twin lights in the
Christian firmament--whose favour was less easily won by Christian
piety, however eminent, than by the learning of the Arab or the Jew.
When compelled at last to fulfil a promise extorted from him of
conducting a crusade to the Holy Land, he scandalised Christendom by
making friends of the Sultan, and by using his presence in the East, not
for the deliverance of the Sepulchre, but for the furtherance of
learning and commerce. Thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge by
proving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas of the Church
could be met by one who was armed in unbelief. Literature, art, and
manners were sedulously cultivated in his Sicilian court, and among the
able ministers whom he selected or formed, the modern idea of the State
may be said to have had its birth. Free thinker and free liver, poet,
warrior, and statesman, he stood forward against the sombre background
of the Middle Ages a figure in every respect so brilliant and original
as well to earn from his contemporaries the title of the Wonder of the
World.

On the goodwill of Italians Frederick had the claim of being the most
Italian of all the Emperors since the revival of the Western Empire, and
the only one of them whose throne was permanently set on Italian soil.
Yet he never won the popular heart. To the common mind he always
appeared as something outlandish and terrible--as the man who had driven
a profitable but impious trade in the Sultan's land. Dante, in his
childhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and we find him keenly
interested in the character of the Emperor who came nearest to uniting
Italy into a great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome for
every man of intellect, and in whom a great original poet would have
found a willing and munificent patron. In the _Inferno_, by the mouth of
Pier delle Vigne, the Imperial Chancellor, he pronounces Frederick to
have been worthy of all honour;[5] yet justice requires him to lodge
this flower of kings in the burning tomb of the Epicureans, as having
been guilty of the arch-heresy of denying the moral government of the
world, and holding that with the death of the body all is ended.[6] It
was a heresy fostered by the lives of many churchmen, high and low; but
the example of Frederick encouraged the profession of it by nobles and
learned laymen. On Frederick's character there was a still darker stain
than this of religious indifference--that of cold-blooded cruelty. Even
in an age which had produced Ezzelino Romano, the Emperor's cloaks of
lead were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.[7] But, with
all his genius, and his want of scruple in the choice of means, he built
nothing politically that was not ere his death crumbling to dust. His
enduring work was that of an intellectual reformer under whose
protection and with whose personal help his native language was refined,
Europe was enriched with a learning new to it or long forgotten, and the
minds of men, as they lost their blind reverence for Rome, were prepared
for a freer treatment of all the questions with which religion deals. He
was thus in some respects a precursor of Dante.

More than once in the course of Frederick's career it seemed as if he
might become master of Tuscany in fact as well as in name, had Florence
only been as well affected to him as were Siena and Pisa. But already,
as has been said, the popular interest had been strengthened by
accessions from among the nobles. Others of them, without descending
into the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes on being the first
in a commonwealth rather than privates in the Imperial garrison. These
men, with their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous to have
for allies as for foes, but by throwing their weight into the popular
scale they at least served to hold the Imperialist magnates in check,
and established something like a balance in the fighting power of
Florence; and so, as in the days of Barbarossa, the city was preserved
from taking a side too strongly. The hearts of the Florentine traders
were in their own affairs--in extending their commerce and increasing
their territory and influence in landward Tuscany. As regarded the
general politics of Italy, their sympathy was still with the Roman See;
but it was a sympathy without devotion or gratitude. For refusing to
join in the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict by
Gregory IX. The Emperor meanwhile was acknowledged as its lawful
overlord, and his vicar received something more than nominal obedience,
the choice of the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.
Yet with all this, and although his party was powerful in the city, it
was but a grudging service that was yielded to Frederick. More than once
fines were levied on the Florentines; and worse punishments were
threatened for their persevering and active enmity to Siena, now
dominated by its nobles and held in the Imperial interest. Volunteers
from Florence might join the Emperor in his Lombard campaigns; but they
were left equally free by the Commonwealth to join the other side. At
last, when he was growing old, and when like his grandfather he had been
foiled by the stubborn Lombards, he turned on the Florentines as an
easier prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize the city.
For months the streets were filled with battle. In January 1248,
Frederick of Antioch, the natural son of the Emperor, entered Florence
with some squadrons of men-at-arms, and a few days later the nobles that
had fought on the popular side were driven into banishment. This is
known in the Florentine annals as the first dispersion of the Guelfs.

Long before they were adopted in Italy, the names of Guelf and Ghibeline
had been employed in Germany to mark the partisans of the Bavarian Welf
and of the Hohenstaufen lords of Waiblingen. On Italian soil they
received an extended meaning: Ghibeline stood for Imperialist; Guelf for
anti-Imperialist, Papalist, or simply Nationalist. When the names began
to be freely used in Florence, which was towards the close of
Frederick's reign and about a century after their first invention, they
denoted no new start in politics, but only supplied a nomenclature for
parties already in existence. As far as Florence was concerned, the
designations were the more convenient that they were not too closely
descriptive. The Ghibeline was the Emperor's man, when it served his
purpose to be so; while the Guelf, constant only in his enmity to the
Ghibelines, was free to think of the Pope as he chose, and to serve him
no more than he wished or needed to. Ultimately, indeed, all Florence
may be said to have become Guelf. To begin with, the name distinguished
the nobles who sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles who
looked on these as they might have done on serfs newly thriven into
wealth. Each party was to come up in turn. Within a period of twenty
years each was twice driven into banishment, a measure always
accompanied with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of private
strongholds in Florence. The exiles kept well together, retreating, as
it were in the order of war, to camps of observation they found ready
prepared for them in the nearest cities and fortresses held by those of
their own way of thinking. All their wits were then bent on how, by dint
of some fighting and much diplomacy, they might shake the strength and
undermine the credit of their successful rivals in the city, and secure
their own return in triumph. It was an art they were proud to be adepts
in.[8]

In a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to tell half the
changes made on the constitution of Florence during the second part of
the thirteenth century. Dante in a well-known passage reproaches
Florence with the political restlessness which afflicted her like a
disease. Laws, he says, made in October were fallen into desuetude ere
mid-November.[9] And yet it may be that in this constant readiness to
change, lies the best proof of the political capacity of the
Florentines. It was to meet new necessities that they made provision of
new laws. Especial watchfulness was called for against the encroachments
of the grandees, whose constant tendency--whatever their party
name--was to weaken legal authority, and play the part of lords and
masters of the citizens. But these were no mere weavers and
quill-drivers to be plundered at will. Even before the return of the
Guelfs, banished in 1248, the citizens, taking advantage of a check
suffered in the field by the dominant Ghibelines, had begun to recast
the constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the townsmen as a
militia on a permanent footing. When, on the death of Frederick in 1250,
the Imperialist nobles were left without foreign aid, there began a
period of ten years, favourably known in Florentine history as the
Government of the _Primo Popolo_ or _Popolo Vecchio_; that is, of the
true body of the citizens, commoners possessed of franchises, as
distinguished from the nobles above them and the multitude below. For it
is never to be forgotten that Florence, like Athens, and like the other
Italian Republics, was far from being a true democracy. The time was yet
to come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of citizenship were
to be more widely opened than now to those below, and more closely shut
to those above. In the meantime the comparatively small number of
wealthy citizens who legally composed the 'People' made good use of
their ten years of breathing-time, entering on commercial treaties and
widening the possessions of the Commonwealth, now by war, and now by
shrewd bargains with great barons. To balance the influence of the
Podesta, who had hitherto been the one great officer of State--criminal
judge, civil governor, and commander-in-chief all in one--they created
the office of Captain of the People. The office of Podesta was not
peculiar to Florence. There, as in other cities, in order to secure his
impartiality, it was provided that he should be a foreigner, and hold
office only for six months. But he was also required to be of gentle
birth; and his councils were so composed that, like his own, their
sympathies were usually with the nobles. The Captain of the People was
therefore created partly as a tribune for the protection of the popular
rights, and partly to act as permanent head of the popular forces. Like
the Podesta, he had two councils assigned to him; but these were
strictly representative of the citizens, and sat to control his conduct
as well as to lend to his action the weight of public opinion.

Such of the Ghibelines as had not been banished from Florence on the
death of Frederick, lived there on sufferance, as it were, and under a
rigid supervision. Once more they were to find a patron and ally in a
member of the great house of Hohenstaufen; and with his aid they were
again for a few years to become supreme in Florence, and to prove by
their abuse of power how well justified was the mistrust the people had
of them. In many ways Manfred, one of Frederick's bastards, was a worthy
son of his father. Like him he was endowed with great personal charm,
and was enamoured of all that opened new regions to intellectual
curiosity or gave refinement to sensual pleasure. In his public as well
as in his private behaviour, he was reckless of what the Church and its
doctrines might promise or threaten; and equally so, his enemies
declared, of the dictates of common humanity. Hostile eyes detected in
the green clothes which were his favourite dress a secret attachment to
Islam; and hostile tongues charged him with the murder of a father and
of a brother, and the attempted murder of a nephew. His ambition did not
aim at the Empire, but only at being King of Sicily and Naples, lands
which the Hohenstaufens claimed as their own through the Norman mother
of Frederick. Of these kingdoms he was actual ruler, even while his
legitimate brother Conrad lived. On the death of that prince he brushed
aside the claims of Conradin, his nephew, and bid boldly for recognition
by the Pope, who claimed to be overlord of the southern kingdoms--a
recognition refused, or given only to be immediately withdrawn. In the
eyes of Rome he was no more than Prince of Tarentum, but by arms and
policy he won what seemed a firm footing in the South; and eight years
after the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_ began in Florence he was the
acknowledged patron of all in Italy who had been Imperialist--for the
Imperial throne was now practically vacant. And Manfred was trusted all
the more that he cared nothing for Germany, and stood out even more
purely an Italian monarch than his father had ever been. The Ghibelines
of Florence looked to him to free them of the yoke under which they
groaned.

When it was discovered that they were treating with Manfred, there was
an outburst of popular wrath against the disaffected nobles. Some of
them were seized and put to death, a fate shared by the Abbot of
Vallombrosa, whom neither his priestly office nor his rank as Papal
Legate availed to save from torture and a shameful end.[10] Well
accustomed as was the age to violence and cruelty, it was shocked at
this free disposal of a great ecclesiastic by a mercantile community;
and even to the Guelf chronicler Villani the terrible defeat of
Montaperti seemed no more than a just vengeance taken by Heaven upon a
crime so heinous.[11] In the meantime the city was laid under interdict,
and those concerned in the Abbot's death were excommunicated; while the
Ghibelines, taking refuge in Siena, began to plot and scheme with the
greater spirit against foes who, in the very face of a grave peril, had
offended in the Pope their strongest natural ally.

The leader of the exiles was Farinata, one of the Uberti, a family
which, so long ago as 1180, had raised a civil war to force their way
into the consulship. Ever since, they had been the most powerful,
perhaps, and certainly the most restless, clan in Florence, rich in men
of strong character, fiercely tenacious of their purpose. Such was
Farinata. To the Florentines of a later age he was to stand for the type
of the great Ghibeline gentleman, haughty as Lucifer, a Christian in
name though scarcely by profession, and yet almost beloved for his frank
excess of pride. It detracted nothing from the grandeur of his
character, in the judgment of his countrymen, that he could be cunning
as well as brave. Manfred was coy to afford help to the Tuscan
Ghibelines, standing out for an exorbitant price for the loan of his
men-at-arms; and to Farinata was attributed the device by which his
point of honour was effectually touched.[12] When at last a
reinforcement of eight hundred cavalry entered Siena, the exiles and
their allies felt themselves more than a match for the militia of
Florence, and set themselves to decoy it into the field. Earlier in the
same year the Florentines had encamped before Siena, and sought in vain
to bring on a general engagement. They were now misled by false
messengers, primed by Farinata, into a belief that the Sienese, weary of
the arrogance of Provenzano Salvani,[13] then all-powerful in Siena,
were ready to betray a gate to them. In vain did Tegghiaio
Aldobrandi,[14] one of the Guelf nobles, counsel delay till the German
men-at-arms, wearied with waiting on and perhaps dissatisfied with their
wages, should be recalled by Manfred. A march in full strength upon the
hostile city was resolved on by the eager townsmen.

The battle of Montaperti was fought in September 1260, among the earthy
hills washed by the Arbia and its tributary rivulets, a few miles to the
east of Siena. It marked the close of the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_.
Till then no such disastrous day had come to Florence; and the defeat
was all the more intolerable that it was counted for a victory to Siena.
Yet the battle was far from being a test of the strength of the two
rival cities. Out of the thirty thousand foot in the Guelf army, there
were only about five thousand Florentines. In the host which poured out
on them from Siena, beside the militia of that city and the Florentine
exiles, were included the Ghibelines of Arezzo, the retainers of great
lords still unsubdued by any city, and, above all, the German
men-at-arms of Manfred.[15] But the worst enemies of Florence were the
traitors in her own ranks. She bore it long in mind that it was her
merchants and handicraftsmen who stood stubbornly at bay, and tinged the
Arbia red with their life-blood; while it was among the men of high
degree that the traitors were found. On one of them, Bocca degli Abati,
who struck off the right hand of the standard-bearer of the cavalry, and
so helped on the confusion and the rout, Dante takes vengeance in his
pitiless verse.[16]

The fortifications of Florence had been recently completed and
strengthened, and it was capable of a long defence. But the spirit of
the people was broken for the time, and the conquerors found the gates
open. Then it was that Farinata almost atoned for any wrong he ever did
his native town, by withstanding a proposal made by the Ghibelines of
the rival Tuscan cities, that Florence should be destroyed, and Empoli
advanced to fill her room. 'Alone, with open face I defended her,' Dante
makes him say.[17] But the wonder would rather be if he had voted to
destroy a city of which he was about to be one of the tyrants. Florence
had now a fuller experience than ever of the oppression which it was in
the character of the Ghibelines to exercise. A rich booty lay ready to
their hands; for in the panic after Montaperti crowds of the best in
Florence had fled, leaving all behind them except their wives and
children, whom they would not trust to the cruel mercy of the victors.
It was in this exile that for the first time the industrious citizen was
associated with the Guelf noble. From Lucca, not powerful enough to
grant them protection for long, they were driven to Bologna, suffering
terribly on the passage of the Apennines from cold and want of food, but
safe when the mountains lay between them and the Val d'Arno. While the
nobles and young men with a taste for fighting found their livelihood in
service against the Lombard Ghibelines, the more sober-minded scattered
themselves to seek out their commercial correspondents and increase
their acquaintance with the markets of Europe. When at length the way
was open for them to return home, they came back educated by travel, as
men must always be who travel for a purpose; and from this second exile
of the Guelfs dates a vast extension of the commerce of Florence.

Their return was a fruit of the policy followed by the Papal Court The
interests of both were the same. The Roman See could have as little
independence of action while a hostile monarch was possessed of the
southern kingdoms, as the people of Florence could have freedom while
the Ghibeline nobility had for patron a military prince, to whom their
gates lay open by way of Siena and Pisa. To Sicily and Naples the Pope
laid claim by an alternative title--they were either dependent on the
See of Rome, or, if they were Imperial fiefs, then, in the vacancy of
the Empire, the Pope, as the only head of Christendom, had a right to
dispose of them as he would. A champion was needed to maintain the
claim, and at length the man was found in Charles of Anjou, brother of
St. Louis. This was a prince of intellectual powers far beyond the
common, of untiring industry in affairs, pious, 'chaste as a monk,' and
cold-hearted as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in short, that
make a man feared and well served, and with none that make him beloved.
He was not one to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight,
and his measures were taken with such prudence that by the time he
landed in Italy his victory was almost assured. He found his enemy at
Benevento, in the Neapolitan territory (February 1266). In order to get
time for reinforcements to come up, Manfred sought to enter into
negotiations; but Charles was ready, and knew his advantage. He answered
with the splendid confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missed
an earthly triumph. 'Go tell the Sultan of Lucera,'[18] was his reply,
'that to-day I shall send him to Hell, or he will send me to Paradise.'
Manfred was slain, and his body, discovered only after long search, was
denied Christian burial. Yet, excommunicated though he was, and
suspected of being at heart as much Mohammedan as Christian, he, as well
as his great rival, is found by Dante in Purgatory.[19] And, while the
Christian poet pours his invective on the pious Charles,[20] he is at no
pains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of the frank and
handsome Manfred, all whose followers adored him. He, as more than once
it happens in the _Comedy_ to those whose memory is dear to the poet, is
saved from Inferno by the fiction that in the hour of death he sent one
thought heavenward--'so wide is the embrace of infinite mercy.'[21]

To Florence Charles proved a useful if a greedy and exacting protector.
Under his influence as Pacificator of Tuscany--an office created for him
by the Pope--the Guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, and
the Ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition of dependence
on the goodwill of the citizens over whom they had so lately domineered.
Henceforth failure attended every effort they made to lift their heads.
The stubbornly irreconcilable were banished or put to death. Elaborate
provisions were enacted in obedience to the Pope's commands, by which
the rest were to be at peace with their old foes. Now they were to live
in the city, but under disabilities as regarded eligibility to offices;
now they were to be represented in the public councils, but so as to be
always in a minority. The result of the measures taken, and of the
natural drift of things, was that ere many more years had passed there
were no avowed Ghibelines in Florence.

One influence constantly at work in this direction was that of the
_Parte Guelfa_, a Florentine society formed to guard the interests of
the Guelfs, and which was possessed of the greater part of the Ghibeline
property confiscated after the triumph of Charles had turned the balance
of power in Italy. This organisation has been well described as a state
within a state, and it seems as if the part it played in the Florentine
politics of this period were not yet fully known. This much seems sure,
that the members of the Society were mostly Guelf nobles; that its
power, derived from the administration of vast wealth to a political
end, was so great that the Captain of the _Parte Guelfa_ held a place
almost on a level with that of the chief officials of the Commonwealth;
and that it made loans of ready money to Florence and the Pope, on
condition of their being used to the damage of the Ghibelines.[22]

The Commonwealth, busy in resettling its government, was but slightly
interested in much that went on around it. The boy Conradin, grandson of
Frederick, nephew of Manfred, and in a sense the last of the
Hohenstaufens, came to Italy to measure himself with Charles, and paid
for his audacity upon the scaffold.[23] Charles deputed Guy of Montfort,
son of the great Earl Simon, to be his vicar in Florence. The Pope
smiled and frowned in turn on the Florentines, as their devotion to him
waxed and waned; and so he did on his champion Charles, whose ambition
was apt to outrun his piety. All this was of less importance to the
Commonwealth than the promotion of its domestic interests. It saw with
equanimity a check given to Charles by the election of a new Emperor in
Rudolf of Hapsburg (1273), and a further check by the Sicilian Vespers,
which lost him half his kingdom (1283). But Siena and Pisa, Arezzo, and
even Pistoia, were the objects of a sleepless anxiety. Pisa was the
chief source of danger, being both from sentiment and interest
stubbornly Ghibeline. When at length its power was broken by Genoa, its
great maritime rival, in the naval battle of Meloria (1284), there was
no longer any city in Tuscany to be compared for wealth and strength
with Florence.


III.

It was at this period that Dante, reaching the age of manhood, began to
perform the duties that fell to him as a youthful citizen--duties which,
till the age of thirty was reached, were chiefly those of military
service. The family to which he belonged was a branch of the Elisei,
who are included by Villani in the earliest catalogue given by him of
the great Florentine houses. Cacciaguida, one of the Elisei, born in
1106, married a daughter of the Aldighieri, a family of Ferrara. Their
son was christened Aldighiero, and this was adopted by the family as a
surname, afterwards changed to Alighieri. The son of Aldighiero was
Bellincione, father of Aldighiero II., the father of Dante.

It serves no purpose to fill a page of biography with genealogical
details when the hero's course in life was in no way affected by the
accident of who was his grandfather. In the case of Dante, his position
in the State, his political creed, and his whole fashion of regarding
life, were vitally influenced by the circumstances of his birth. He knew
that his genius, and his genius alone, was to procure him fame; he
declares a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of nobility:
and yet his family pride is always breaking through. In real life, from
his family's being decayed in wealth and fallen in consideration
compared with its neighbours, he may have been led to put emphasis on
his assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty and humiliations of his
exile he may have found a tonic in the thought that by birth, not to
speak of other things, he was the equal of those who spurned him or
coldly lent him aid. However this may be, there is a tacit claim of
equality with them in the easy grace with which he encounters great
nobles in the world of shades. The bent of his mind in relation to this
subject is shown by such a touch as that when he esteems it among the
glories of Francis of Assisi not to have been ashamed of his base
extraction.[24] In Paradise he meets his great crusading ancestor
Cacciaguida, and feigns contrition for the pleasure with which he
listens to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their common
blood.[25] In Inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and terrible, of a
kinsman whose violent death had remained unavenged; and, for the nonce,
the philosopher-poet is nothing but the member of an injured Florentine
clan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood feud.[26] And when
Farinata, the great Ghibeline, and haughtiest of all the Florentines of
the past generation, asks him, 'Who were thine ancestors?' Dante says
with a proud pretence of humility, 'Anxious to obey, I hid nothing, but
told him all he demanded.'[27]

Dante was born in Florence in the May of 1265.[28] A brother of his
father had been one of the guards of the Florentine Caroccio, or
standard-bearing car, at the battle of Montaperti (1260). Whether
Dante's father necessarily shared in the exile of his party may be
doubted. He is said--on slight authority--to have been a jurisconsult:
there is no reason to suppose he was at Montaperti. It is difficult to
believe that Florence was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants as
a consequence of the Ghibeline victory. In any case, it is certain that
while the fugitive Guelfs were mostly accompanied by their wives, and
did not return till 1267, we have Dante's own word for it that he was
born in the great city by the Arno,[29] and was baptized in the
Baptistery, his beautiful St. John's.[30] At the font he received the
name of Durante, shortened, as he bore it, into Dante. It is in this
form that it finds a place in the _Comedy_,[31] once, and only once,
written down of necessity, the poet says--the necessity of being
faithful in the report of Beatrice's words: from the wider necessity, we
may assume, of imbedding in the work itself the name by which the author
was commonly known, and by which he desired to be called for all time.

When Dante was about ten years old he lost his father. Of his mother
nothing but her Christian name of Bella is known. Neither of them is
mentioned in the _Comedy_,[32] nor indeed are his wife and children.
Boccaccio describes the Alighieri as having been in easy though not in
wealthy circumstances; and Leonardo Bruni, who in the fifteenth century
sought out what he could learn of Dante, says of him that he was
possessed of a patrimony sufficient for an honourable livelihood. That
he was so might be inferred from the character of the education he
received. His studies, says Boccaccio, were not directed to any object
of worldly profit. That there is no sign of their having been directed
by churchmen tends to prove the existence in his native town of a class
of cultivated laymen; and that there was such appears from the ease
with which, when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a craving for
intellectual and congenial society, he found in nobles of the stamp of
Guido Cavalcanti men like-minded with himself. It was indeed impossible
but that the revival of the study of the civil law, the importation of
new learning from the East, and the sceptical spirit fostered in Italy
by the influence of Frederick II. and his court, should all have told on
the keen-witted Florentines, of whom a great proportion--even of the
common people--could read; while the class with leisure had every
opportunity of knowing what was going on in the world.[33] Heresy, the
rough word for intellectual life as well as for religious aspiration,
had found in Florence a congenial soil.[34] In the thirteenth century,
which modern ignorance loves to reckon as having been in a special sense
an age of faith, there were many Florentines who, in spite of their
outward conformity, had drifted as far from spiritual allegiance to the
Church as the furthest point reached by any of their descendants who
some two ages later belonged to the school of Florentine Platonists.

Chief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say, free-livers--though
in this respect they were less distinguished from the orthodox--was
Brunetto Latini, for some time Secretary to the Republic, and the
foremost Italian man of letters of his day. Meagre though his greatest
work, the _Tesoro_, or _Treasure_, must seem to any one who now glances
over its pages, to his contemporaries it answered the promise of its
title and stood for a magazine of almost complete information in the
domains of natural history, ethics, and politics. It was written in
French, as being a more agreeable language than Italian; and was
composed, there is reason to believe, while Latini lived in Paris as an
exiled Guelf after Montaperti. His _Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, a
poem in jingling eight-syllabled Italian verse, has been thought by some
to have supplied hints to Dante for the _Comedy_.[35] By neither of
these works is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of good
taste. Yet there is the testimony of Villani that he did much to refine
the language of his contemporaries, and to apply fixed principles to the
conduct of State affairs.[36] Dante meets him in Inferno, and hails him
as his intellectual father--as the master who taught him from day to day
how fame is to be won.[37] But it is too much to infer from these words
that Latini served as his teacher, in the common sense of the word. It
is true they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar and his
young townsman; but the closeness of their intercourse is perhaps best
accounted for by supposing that Latini had been acquainted with Dante's
father, and by the great promise of Dante's boyhood was led to take a
warm interest in his intellectual development. Their intimacy, to judge
from the tone of their conversation down in Inferno, had lasted till
Latini's death. But no tender reminiscence of the days they spent
together avails to save him from condemnation at the hands of his severe
disciple. By the manners of Brunetto, and the Epicurean heresies of
others of his friends, Dante, we may be sure, was never infected or
defiled.

Dante describes himself as having begun the serious study of philosophy
and theology only at the mature age of twenty-seven. But ere that time
he had studied to good effect, and not books alone, but the world around
him too, and the world within. The poet was formed before the theologian
and philosopher. From his earliest years he was used to write in verse;
and he seems to have esteemed as one of his best endowments the easy
command of his mother tongue acquired by him while still in boyhood.

Of the poems written in his youth he made a selection, and with a
commentary gave them to the world as his first work.[38] All the sonnets
and canzoni contained in it bear more or less directly on his love for
Beatrice Portinari. This lady, whose name is so indissolubly associated
with that of Dante, was the daughter of a rich citizen of good family.
When Dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she a few months
younger. It would seem fabulous, he says, if he related what things he
did, and of what a passion he was the victim during his boyhood. He
seized opportunities of beholding her, but for long never passed beyond
a silent worship; and he was eighteen before she spoke to him, and then
only in the way of a passing salutation. On this he had a vision, and
that inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the first he had written,
but the first he put into circulation. The mode of publication he
adopted was the common one of sending copies of it to such other poets
as were within reach. The sonnet in itself contains a challenge to
interpret his dream. Several poets attempted the riddle--among them the
philosopher and poet Guido Cavalcanti. They all failed in the solution;
but with some of them he was thus brought into terms of intimacy, and
with Cavalcanti of the closest friendship. Some new grace of style in
Dante's verse, some art in the presentation of his mystical meaning that
escapes the modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged man of
letters that a new genius had arisen. It was by Guido's advice that the
poems of which this sonnet stands the first were some years later
collected and published with the explanatory narrative. To him, in a
sense, the whole work is addressed; and it agreed with his taste, as
well as Dante's own, that it should contain nothing but what was written
in the vulgar tongue. Others besides Guido must have recognised in the
little book, as it passed from hand to hand, the masterpiece of Italian
prose, as well as of Italian verse. In the simple title of _Vita Nuova_,
or _The New Life_,[39] we can fancy that a claim is laid to originality
of both subject and treatment. Through the body of the work, though not
so clearly as in the _Comedy_, there rings the note of assurance of
safety from present neglect and future oblivion.

It may be owing to the free use of personification and symbol in the
_Vita Nuova_ that some critics, while not denying the existence of a
real Beatrice, have held that she is introduced only to help out an
allegory, and that, under the veil of love for her, the poet would
express his youthful passion for truth. Others, going to the opposite
extreme, are found wondering why he never sought, or, seeking, failed to
win, the hand of Beatrice. To those who would refine the Beatrice of the
early work into a being as purely allegorical as she of the _Comedy_, it
may be conceded that the _Vita Nuova_ is not so much the history of a
first love as of the new emotional and intellectual life to which a
first love, as Dante experienced it, opens the door. Out of the
incidents of their intercourse he chooses only such as serve for motives
to the joys and sorrows of the passionate aspiring soul. On the other
hand, they who seek reasons why Dante did not marry Beatrice have this
to justify their curiosity, that she did marry another man. But her
husband was one of the rich and powerful Bardi; and her father was so
wealthy that after providing for his children he could endow a hospital
in Florence. The marriage was doubtless arranged as a matter of family
convenience, due regard being had to her dower and her husband's
fortune; and we may assume that when Dante, too, was married later on,
his wife was found for him by the good offices of his friends.[40] Our
manners as regards these things are not those of the Italy of the
thirteenth century. It may safely be said that Dante never dreamed of
Beatrice for his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would have
sealed his lips from uttering to the world any word of his love; and
that she would have lost something in his esteem if, out of love for
him, she had refused the man her father chose for her.

We must not seek in the _Vita Nuova_ what it does not profess to give.
There was a real Beatrice Portinari, to a careless glance perhaps not
differing much from other Florentine ladies of her age and condition;
but her we do not find in Dante's pages. These are devoted to a record
of the dreams and visions, the new thoughts and feelings of which she
was the occasion or the object. He worshipped at a distance, and in a
single glance found reward enough for months of adoration; he read all
heaven into a smile. So high strung is the narrative, that did we come
on any hint of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest She is
always at a distance from him, less a woman than an angel.

In all this there is certainly as much of reticence as of exaggeration.
When he comes to speak of her death he uses a phrase on which it would
seem as if too little value had been set. He cannot dwell on the
circumstances of her departure, he says, without being his own
panegyrist. Taken along with some other expressions in the _Vita Nuova_,
and the tone of her words to him when they meet in the Earthly Paradise,
we may gather from this that not only was she aware of his long
devotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to understand how
highly she rated it. And on the occasion of her death, one described as
being her nearest relative by blood and, after Cavalcanti, Dante's chief
friend--her brother, no doubt--came to him and begged him to write
something concerning her. It would be strange indeed if they had never
looked frankly into one another's faces; and yet, for anything that is
directly told in the _Vita Nuova_, they never did.

The chief value of the _Vita Nuova_ is therefore psychological. It is a
mine of materials illustrative of the author's mental and emotional
development, but as regards historical details it is wanting in fulness
and precision. Yet, even in such a sketch of Dante's life as this tries
to be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points of the narrative
contained in the _Vita Nuova_; the reader always remembering that on one
side Dante says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love, and
less on another that he may not fail in consideration for Beatrice. She
is first a maiden whom no public breath is to disturb in her virgin
calm; and afterwards a chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of her
reputation as any husband could be. The youthful lover had begun by
propounding the riddle of his love so obscurely that even by his
fellow-poets it had been found insoluble, adepts though they themselves
were in the art of smothering a thought. Then, though all his longing is
for Beatrice, lest she become the subject of common talk he feigns that
he is in love first with one lady and then with another.[41] He even
pushes his deceit so far that she rebukes him for his fickleness to one
of his sham loves by denying him the customary salutation when they
meet--this salutation being the only sign of friendship she has ever
shown. It is already some few years since the first sonnet was written.
Now, in a ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than he has
yet ventured on,[42] he protests that it was always Beatrice his heart
was busy with, and that to her, though his eyes may have seemed to
wander, his affection was always true. In the very next poem we find him
as if debating with himself whether he shall persevere. He weighs the
ennobling influence of a pure love and the sweetness it gives to life,
against the pains and self-denial to which it condemns its servant.
Here, he tells us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who has
come to where the ways divide. His only means of escape--and he feels it
is a poor one--is to throw himself into the arms of Pity.

From internal evidence it seems reasonably certain that the marriage of
Beatrice fell at the time when he describes himself as standing at the
parting of the ways. Before that he has been careful to write of his
love in terms so general as to be understood only by those in possession
of the key. Now he makes direct mention of her, and seeks to be in her
company; and he even leads us to infer that it was owing to his poems
that she became a well-known personage in the streets of Florence.
Immediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse to Pity, he tells
how he was led by a friend into the house of a lady, married only that
day, whom they find surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate her
home-coming after marriage. It was the fashion for young gentlemen to
offer their services at such a feast. On this occasion Dante for one can
give no help. A sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for support
against the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting his eyes to see
if the ladies have remarked his plight, he is troubled at beholding
Beatrice among them, with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,
they mock at her lover's weakness. To his friend, who, as he leads him
from the chamber, asks what ails him, he replies: 'My feet have reached
that point beyond which if they pass they can never return.' It was only
matrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming; Beatrice was
therefore by this time a married woman. That she was but newly married
we may infer from Dante's confusion on finding her there.[43] His secret
has now been discovered, and he must either renounce his love, or, as he
is at length free to do, Beatrice being married, declare it openly, and
spend his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of his
imagination and of his heart.[44]

But how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and make use of his new
privilege of freer intercourse, when the very sight of her so unmans
him? He writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity in
him, and resolves to write no more. Now comes the most fruitful episode
in the history. Questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of a
love like his, that cannot even face the object of its desire, he
answers that his happiness lies in the words by which he shows forth the
praises of his mistress. He has now discovered that his passion is its
own reward. In other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his love;
although to a careless reader it might seem in little need of passing
through the process. Then, soon after, as he walks by a crystal brook,
he is inspired with the words which begin the noblest poem he had yet
produced,[45] and that as the author of which he is hailed by a
fellow-poet in Purgatory. It is the first to glorify Beatrice as one in
whom Heaven is more concerned than Earth; and in it, too, he anticipates
his journey through the other world. She dies,[46] and we are surprised
to find that within a year of her death he wavers in his allegiance to
her memory. A fair face, expressing a tender compassion, looks down on
him from a window as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves the
owner of the face because she pities him. But seeing Beatrice in a
vision he is restored, and the closing sonnet tells how his whole desire
goes forth to her, and how his spirit is borne above the highest sphere
to behold her receiving honour, and shedding radiance on all around her.
The narrative closes with a reference to a vision which he does not
recount, but which incites him to severe study in order that he may
learn to write of her as she deserves. And the last sentence of the
_Vita Nuova_ expresses a hope--a hope which would be arrogant coming
after anything less perfect than the _Vita Nuova_--that, concerning her,
he shall yet say things never said before of any woman. Thus the poet's
earliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his morning makes
one day with his evening.

The narrative of the _Vita Nuova_ is fluent and graceful, in this
contrasting strongly with the analytical arguments attached to the
various poems. Dante treats his readers as if they were able to catch
the meaning of the most recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of the
alphabet of literary form. And, as is the case with other poets of the
time, the free movement of his fancy is often hampered by the necessity
he felt of expressing himself in the language of the popular scholastic
philosophy. All this is but to say that he was a man of his period, as
well as a great genius. And even in this his first work he bettered the
example of Guido Cavalcanti, Guido of Bologna, and the others whom he
found, but did not long suffer to remain, the masters of Italian
verse.[47] These inherited from the Provençal and Sicilian poets much
of the cant of which European poetry has been so slow to clear itself;
and chiefly that of presenting all human emotion and volition under the
figure of love for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,
set up to act as Queen of Beauty while the poet ran his intellectual
jousts. But Dante dealt in no feigned inspiration, and distinguishes
himself from the whole school of philosophical and artificial poets as
'one who can only speak as love inspires.'[48] He may deal in allegory
and utter sayings dark enough, but the first suggestions of his thoughts
are obtained from facts of emotion or of real life. His lady was no
creature of fancy, but his neighbour Beatrice Portinari: and she who
ends in the _Paradiso_ as the embodied beauty of holiness was, to begin
with, a fair Florentine girl.

The instance of Beatrice is the strongest, although others might be
adduced, to illustrate Dante's economy of actual experience; the skilful
use, that is, of real emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion and
material of poetical thought. As has been told, towards the close of the
_Vita Nuova_ he describes how he found a temporary consolation for the
loss of Beatrice in the pity of a fair and noble lady. In his next work,
the _Convito_, or _Banquet_, she appears as the personification of
philosophy. The plan of the _Convito_ is that of a commentary on odes
which are interpreted as having various meanings--among others the
literal as distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true. As
far as this lady is concerned, Dante shows some eagerness to pass from
the literal meaning; desirous, it may be, to correct the belief that he
had ever wavered in his exclusive devotion to Beatrice. That for a time
he did transfer his thoughts from Beatrice in Heaven to the fair lady of
the window is almost certain, and by the time he wrote the _Purgatorio_
he was able to make confession of such a fault. But at the earlier
period at which the _Convito_[49] was written, he may have come to
regard the avowal in the _Vita Nuova_ as an oversight dishonouring to
himself as well as to his first love, and so have slurred it over,
leaving the fact to stand enveloped in an allegory. At any rate, to his
gloss upon this passage in his life we are indebted for an interesting
account of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put himself to school:--

    'After losing the earliest joy of my life, I was so smitten with
    sorrow that in nothing could I find any comfort. Yet after some
    time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since nought that I or
    others could do availed to restore me, directed itself to find how
    people, being disconsolate, had been comforted. And so I took to
    reading that little-known book by Boethius, by writing which he,
    captive and in exile, had obtained relief. Next, hearing that Tully
    as well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he had
    consoled the worthy Laelius on the occasion of the loss of his
    friend Scipio, I read that too. And though at the first I found
    their meaning hard, at last I comprehended it as far as my
    knowledge of the language and some little command of mother-wit
    enabled me to do: which same mother-wit had already helped me to
    much, as may be seen by the _Vita Nuova_. And as it often happens
    that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold he is not
    looking for--the result of chance, or of some divine provision; so
    I, besides finding the consolation I was in search of to dry my
    tears, became possessed of wisdom from authors and sciences and
    books. Weighing this well, I deemed that philosophy, the mistress
    of these authors, sciences, and books, must be the best of all
    things. And imagining her to myself fashioned like a great lady,
    rich in compassion, my admiration of her was so unbounded that I
    was always delighting myself in her image. And from thus beholding
    her in fancy I went on to frequent the places where she is to be
    found in very deed--in the schools of theology, to wit, and the
    debates of philosophers. So that in a little time, thirty months or
    so, I began to taste so much of her sweetness that the love I bore
    to her effaced or banished every other thought.'[50]

No one would guess from this description of how he grew enamoured of
philosophy, that at the beginning of his arduous studies Dante took a
wife. She was Gemma, the daughter of Manetto Donati, but related only
distantly, if at all, to the great Corso Donati. They were married in
1292, he being twenty-seven; and in the course of the nine years that
elapsed till his exile she bore him five sons and two daughters.[51]
From his silence regarding her in his works, and from some words of
Boccaccio's which apply only to the period of his exile, it has been
inferred that the union was unhappy. But Dante makes no mention in his
writings of his parents or children any more than of Gemma.[52] And why
should not his wife be included among the things dearest to him which,
he tells us, he had to leave behind him on his banishment? For anything
we know to the contrary, their wedded life up to the time of his exile
may have been happy enough; although most probably the marriage was one
of convenience, and almost certainly Dante found little in Gemma's mind
that answered to his own.[53] In any case it is not safe to lay stress
upon his silence. During the period covered by the _Vita Nuova_ he
served more than once in the field, and to this none of his earlier
works make any reference. In 1289, Arezzo having warmly espoused the
Ghibeline cause, the Florentines, led by Corso Donati and the great
merchant Vieri dei Cerchi, took up arms and met the foe in the field of
Campaldino, on the edge of the upland region of the Casentino. Dante, as
a young man of means and family, fought in the vanguard;[54] and in a
letter partly preserved by one of his early biographers[55] he describes
himself as being then no tiro in arms, and as having with varying
emotions watched the fortunes of the day. From this it is clear that he
had served before, probably in an expedition into the Aretine territory
made in the previous year, and referred to in the _Inferno_.[56] In the
same year as Campaldino was won he was present at the surrender of
Caprona, a fortress belonging to Pisa.[57] But of all this he is silent
in his works, or only makes casual mention of it by way of illustration.
It is, therefore, a waste of time trying to prove his domestic misery
from his silence about his marriage.


IV.

So hard a student was Dante that he now for a time nearly lost the use
of his eyes.[58] But he was cured by regimen, and came to see as well as
ever, he tells us; which we can easily believe was very well indeed. For
his work, as he planned it out, he needed all his powers. The _Convito_,
for example, was designed to admit of a full treatment of all that
concerns philosophy. It marks an earlier stage of his intellectual and
spiritual life than does the opening of the _Inferno_. In it we have the
fruit of the years during which he was wandering astray from his early
ideal, misled by what he afterwards came to count as a vain and
profitless curiosity. Most of its contents, as we have it,[59] are only
indirectly interesting. It is impossible for most people to care for
discussions, conducted with all the nicety of scholastic definition, on
such subjects as the system of the universe as it was evolved out of the
brains of philosophers; the subject-matter of knowledge; and how we
know. But there is one section of it possessed of a very special
interest, the Fourth, in which he treats of the nature of nobility.
This he affirms to be independent of wealth or ancestry, and he finds
every one to be noble who practises the virtues proper to his time of
life. 'None of the Uberti of Florence or the Visconti of Milan can say
he is noble because belonging to such or such a race; for the Divine
seed is sown not in a family but in the individual man.' This amounts,
it must be admitted, to no more than saying that high birth is one
thing, and nobility of character another; but it is significant of what
were the current opinions, that Dante should be at such pains to
distinguish between the two qualities. The canzone which supplies the
text for the treatise closes with a picture of the noble soul at every
stage of life, to which Chaucer may well have been indebted for his
description of the true gentleman:[60]--'The soul that is adorned by
this grace does not keep it hid, but from the day when soul is wed to
body shows it forth even until death. In early life she is modest,
obedient, and gentle, investing the outward form and all its members
with a gracious beauty: in youth she is temperate and strong, full of
love and courteous ways, delighting in loyal deeds: in mature age she is
prudent, and just, and apt to liberality, rejoicing to hear of others'
good. Then in the fourth stage of life she is married again to God,[61]
and contemplates her approaching end with thankfulness for all the
past.'[62]

In this passage it is less the poet that is heard than the sober
moralist, one with a ripe experience of life, and contemptuous of the
vulgar objects of ambition. The calm is on the surface. As has been said
above, he was proud of his own birth, the more proud perhaps that his
station was but a middling one; and to the close of his life he hated
upstarts with their sudden riches, while the Philip Argenti on whom in
the _Inferno_ he takes what has much the air of a private revenge may
have been only a specimen of the violent and haughty nobles with whom he
stood on an uneasy footing.

Yet the impression we get of Dante's surroundings in Florence from the
_Vita Nuova_ and other poems, from references in the _Comedy_, and from
some anecdotes more or less true which survive in the pages of Boccaccio
and elsewhere, is on the whole a pleasant one. We should mistake did we
think of him as always in the guise of absorbed student or tearful
lover. Friends he had, and society of various kinds. He tells how in a
severe illness he was nursed by a young and noble lady, nearly related
to him by blood--his sister most probably; and other ladies are
mentioned as watching in his sick-chamber.[63] With Forese and Piccarda
Donati, brother and sister of the great Corso Donati, he was on terms of
the warmest friendship.[64] From the _Vita Nuova_ we can gather that,
even when his whole heart fainted and failed at the mere sight of
Beatrice, he was a favourite with other ladies and conversed familiarly
with them. The brother of Beatrice was his dear friend; while among
those of the elder generation he could reckon on the friendship of such
men as Guido Cavalcanti and Brunetto Latini. Through Latini he would,
even as a young man, get the entry of the most lettered and
intellectually active society of Florence. The tradition of his intimacy
with Giotto is supported by the mention he makes of the painter,[65] and
by the fact, referred to in the _Vita Nuova_, that he was himself a
draughtsman. It is to be regretted there are not more anecdotes of him
on record like that which tells how one day as he drew an angel on his
tablets he was broken in upon by 'certain people of importance.' The
musician Casella, whom he 'woes to sing in Purgatory'[66] and Belacqua,
the indolent good-humoured lutemaker,[67] are greeted by him in a tone
of friendly warmth in the one case and of easy familiarity in the other,
which help us to know the terms on which he stood with the quick-witted
artist class in Florence.[68] Already he was in the enjoyment of a high
reputation as a poet and scholar, and there seemed no limit to the
greatness he might attain to in his native town as a man of action as
well as a man of thought.

In most respects the Florence of that day was as fitting a home for a
man of genius as could well be imagined. It was full of a life which
seemed restless only because the possibilities of improvement for the
individual and the community seemed infinite. A true measure of its
political progress and of the activity of men's minds is supplied by the
changes then being made in the outward aspect of the city. The duties of
the Government were as much municipal as political, and it would have
surprised a Florentine to be told that the one kind of service was of
less dignity than the other. The population grew apace, and, to provide
the means for extending the city walls, every citizen, on pain of his
testament being found invalid, was required to bequeath a part of his
estate to the public. Already the banks of the Arno were joined by three
bridges of stone, and the main streets were paved with the
irregularly-shaped blocks of lava still familiar to the sojourner in
Florence. But between the time of Dante's boyhood and the close of the
century the other outstanding features of the city were greatly altered,
or were in the course of change. The most important churches of
Florence, as he first knew it, were the Baptistery and the neighbouring
small cathedral church of Santa Reparata; after these ranked the church
of the Trinity, Santo Stefano, and some other churches which are now
replaced by larger ones, or of which the site alone can be discovered.
On the other side of the river, Samminiato with its elegant façade rose
as now upon its hill.[69] The only great civic building was the Palace
of the Podesta. The Old Market was and had long been the true centre of
the city's life.

At the time Dante went into exile Arnolfo was already working on the
great new cathedral of St. Mary of the Flowers, the spacious Santa
Croce, and the graceful Badia; and Santa Maria Novella was slowly
assuming the perfection of form that was later to make it the favourite
of Michel Angelo. The Palace of the Signory was already planned, though
half a century was to elapse before its tower soared aloft to daunt the
private strongholds which bristled, fierce and threatening, all over the
city. The bell-tower of Giotto, too, was of later erection--the only
pile we can almost regret that Dante never saw. The architect of it was
however already adorning the walls of palace and cloister with paintings
whose inspiration was no longer, like that of the works they
overshadowed, drawn from the outworn motives of Byzantine art, but from
the faithful observation of nature.[70] He in painting and the Pisan
school in sculpture were furnishing the world with novel types of beauty
in the plastic arts, answering to the 'sweet new style' in verse of
which it was Dante that discovered the secret.[71]

Florence was now by far the leading city in Tuscany. Its merchants and
money-dealers were in correspondence with every Mediterranean port and
with every country of the West. Along with bales of goods and letters of
exchange new ideas and fresh intelligence were always on the road to
Florence. The knowledge of what was going on in the world, and of what
men were thinking, was part of the stock-in-trade of the quick-witted
citizens, and they were beginning to be employed throughout Europe in
diplomatic work, till then almost a monopoly of churchmen. 'These
Florentines seem to me to form a fifth element,' said Boniface, who had
ample experience of how accomplished they were.

At home they had full employment for their political genius; and still
upon the old problem, of how to curb the arrogance of the class that, in
place of being satisfied to share in the general prosperity, sought its
profit in the maintenance of privilege. It is necessary, at the cost of
what may look like repetition, to revert to the presence and activity of
this class in Florence, if we are to form a true idea of the
circumstances of Dante's life, and enter into the spirit with which much
of the _Comedy_ is informed. Though many of the nobles were now engaged
in commerce and figured among the popular leaders, most of the greater
houses stood proudly aloof from everything that might corrupt their
gentility. These were styled the magnates: they found, as it were, a
vocation for themselves in being nobles. Among them the true distinctive
spirit of Ghibelinism survived, although none of them would now have
dared to describe himself as a Ghibeline. Their strength lay partly in
the unlimited control they retained over the serfs on their landward
estates; in the loyalty with which the members of a family held by one
another; in their great command of resources as the administrators of
the _Parte Guelfa_; and in the popularity they enjoyed with the smaller
people in consequence of their lavish expenditure, and frank if insolent
manners. By law scarcely the equals of the full citizens, in point of
fact they tyrannised over them. Their houses, set like fortresses in the
crowded streets, frequently served as prisons and torture-chambers for
the low-born traders or artisans who might offend them.

Measures enough had been passed towards the close of the century with a
view to curb the insolence of the magnates; but the difficulty was to
get them put in force. At length, in 1294, they, with many additional
reforms, were embodied in the celebrated Ordinances of Justice. These
for long were counted back to as the Great Charter of Florence--a Great
Charter defining the popular rights and the disabilities of the
baronage. Punishments of special severity were enacted for nobles who
should wrong a plebeian, and the whole of a family or clan was made
responsible for the crimes and liabilities of its several members. The
smaller tradesmen were conciliated by being admitted to a share in
political influence. If serfage was already abolished in the State of
Florence, it was the Ordinances which made it possible for the serf to
use his liberty.[72] But the greatest blow dealt to the nobles by the
new laws was their exclusion, as nobles, from all civil and political
offices. These they could hold only by becoming members of one of the
trade guilds.[73] And to deprive a citizen of his rights it was enough
to inscribe his name in the list of magnates.

It is not known in what year Dante became a member of the Guild of
Apothecaries. Without much reason it has been assumed that he was one of
the nobles who took advantage of the law of 1294. But there is no
evidence that in his time the Alighieri ranked as magnates, and much
ground for believing that for some considerable time past they had
belonged to the order of full citizens.

It was not necessary for every guildsman to practise the art or engage
in the business to which his guild was devoted, and we are not required
to imagine Dante as having anything to do with medicine or with the
spices and precious stones in which the apothecaries traded. The guilds
were political as much as industrial associations, and of the public
duties of his membership he took his full share. The constitution of the
Republic, jealously careful to limit the power of the individual
citizen, provided that the two chief executive officers, the Podesta and
the Captain of the People, should always be foreigners. They held office
only for six months. To each of them was assigned a numerous Council,
and before a law could be abrogated or a new one passed it needed the
approval of both these Councils, as well as that of the Priors, and of
the heads of the principal guilds. The Priors were six in number, one
for each district of the city. With them lay the administration in
general of the laws, and the conduct of foreign affairs. Their office
was elective, and held for two months.[74] Of one or other of the
Councils Dante is known to have been a member in 1295, 1296, 1300, and
1301.[75] In 1299 he is found engaged on a political mission to the
little hill-city of San Gemigniano, where in the town-house they still
show the pulpit from which he addressed the local senate.[76] From the
middle of June till the middle of August 1300 he served as one of the
Priors.[77]

At the time when Dante entered on this office, Florence was distracted
by the feud of Blacks and Whites, names borrowed from the factions of
Pistoia, but fated to become best known from their use in the city which
adopted them. The strength of the Blacks lay in the nobles whom the
Ordinances of Justice had been designed to depress; both such of them as
had retained their standing as magnates, and such as, under the new law,
had unwillingly entered the ranks of the citizens. Already they had
succeeded in driving into exile Giano della Bella,[78] the chief author
of the Ordinances; and their efforts--and those of the citizens who,
fearing the growing power of the lesser guilds, were in sympathy with
them--were steadily directed to upset the reforms. An obvious means to
this end was to lower in popular esteem the public men whose policy it
was to govern firmly on the new lines. The leader of the discontented
party was Corso Donati, a man of small fortune, but of high birth; of
splendid personal appearance, open-handed, and of popular manners. He
and they who went with him affected a violent Guelfism, their chance of
recovering the control of domestic affairs being the better the more
they could frighten the Florentines with threats of evils like those
incurred by the Aretines and Pisans from Ghibeline oppression. It may be
imagined what meaning the cry of Ghibeline possessed in days when there
was still a class of beggars in Florence--men of good names--whose eyes
had been torn out by Farinata and his kind.

One strong claim which Corso Donati had on the goodwill of his
fellow-townsmen was that by his ready courage in pushing on the
reserves, against superior orders, at the battle of Campaldino,[79] the
day had been won to Florence and her allies. As he rode gallantly
through the streets he was hailed as the Baron (_il Barone_), much as in
the last generation the victor of Waterloo was sufficiently
distinguished as the Duke. At the same battle, Vieri dei Cerchi, the
leader of the opposite party of the Whites, had shown no less bravery,
but he was ignorant of the art, or despised it, of making political
capital out of the performance of his duty. In almost every respect he
offered a contrast to Donati. He was of a new family, and his influence
depended not on landed possessions, though he had these too, but on
wealth derived from commerce.[80] According to John Villani, a competent
authority on such a point,[81] he was at the head of one of the greatest
trading houses in the world. The same crowds that cheered Corso as the
great Baron sneered at the reticent and cold-tempered merchant as the
Ghibeline. It was a strange perversion of ideas, and yet had this of
justification, that all the nobles of Ghibeline tendency and all the
citizens who, on account of their birth, were suspected of leaning that
way were driven into the party of the Whites by the mere fact of the
Blacks hoisting so defiantly the Guelf flag, and commanding the
resources of the _Parte Guelfa_. But if Ghibelinism meant, as fifty
years previously it did mean, a tendency to exalt privilege as against
the general liberties and to court foreign interference in the affairs
of Florence, it was the Blacks and not the Whites who had served
themselves heirs to Ghibelinism. That the appeal was now taken to the
Pope instead of to the Emperor did not matter; or that French soldiers
in place of German were called in to settle domestic differences.

The Roman See was at this time filled by Boniface VIII., who six years
previously, by violence and fraud, had procured the resignation of
Celestine V.--him who made the great refusal.[82] Boniface was at once
arrogant and subtle, wholly faithless, and hampered by no scruple
either of religion or humanity. But these qualities were too common
among those who before and after him filled the Papal throne, to secure
him in a special infamy. That he has won from the ruthless hatred which
blazes out against him in many a verse of Dante's,[83] and for this
hatred he is indebted to his interference in the affairs of Florence,
and what came as one of the fruits of it--the poet's exile.

And yet, from the point of view not only of the interest of Rome but
also of Italy, there is much to be said for the policy of Boniface.
German domination was a just subject of fear, and the Imperialist
element was still so strong in Northern and Central Italy, that if the
Emperor Albert[84] had been a man of a more resolute ambition, he
might--so contemporaries deemed--have conquered Italy at the cost of a
march through it. The cities of Romagna were already in Ghibeline
revolt, and it was natural that the Pope should seek to secure Florence
on the Papal side. It was for the Florentines rather than for him to
judge what they would lose or gain by being dragged into the current of
general politics. He made a fair beginning with an attempt to reconcile
the two parties. The Whites were then the dominant faction, and to them
reconciliation meant that their foes would at once divide the
government with them, and at the long-run sap the popular liberties,
while the Pope's hand would soon be allowed to dip freely into the
communal purse. The policy of the Whites was therefore one of steady
opposition to all foreign meddling with Florence. But it failed to
secure general support, for without being Ghibeline in fact it had the
air of being so; and the name of Ghibeline was one that no reasoning
could rob of its terrors.[85]

As was usual in Florence when political feeling ran high, the hotter
partisans came to blows, and the streets were more than once disturbed
by violence and bloodshed. To an onlooker it must have seemed as if the
interposition of some external authority was desirable; and almost on
the same day as the new Priors, of whom Dante was one and who were all
Whites, took office in the June of 1300, the Cardinal Acquasparta
entered the city, deputed by the Pope to establish peace. His proposals
were declined by the party in power, and having failed in his mission he
left the city, and took the priestly revenge upon it of placing it under
interdict.[86] Ere many months were passed, the Blacks, at a meeting of
the heads of the party, resolved to open negotiations anew with
Boniface. For this illegal step some of them, including Corso Donati,
were ordered into exile by the authorities, who, to give an appearance
of impartiality to their proceedings, at the same time banished some of
the Whites, and among them Guido Cavalcanti. It was afterwards made a
charge against Dante that he had procured the recall of his friend Guido
and the other Whites from exile; but to this he could answer that he was
not then in office.[87] Corso in the meantime was using his enforced
absence from Florence to treat freely with the Pope.

Boniface had already entered into correspondence with Charles of Valois,
brother of Philip, the reigning King of France, with the view of
securing the services of a strongly-connected champion. It was the game
that had been played before by the Roman Court when Charles of Anjou was
called to Italy to crush the Hohenstaufens. This second Charles was a
man of ability of a sort, as he had given cruel proof in his brother's
Flemish wars. By the death of his wife, daughter of his kinsman Charles
II. of Naples and so grand-daughter of Charles of Anjou, he had lost the
dominions of Maine and Anjou, and had got the nickname of Lackland from
his want of a kingdom. He lent a willing ear to Boniface, who presented
him with the crown of Sicily on condition that he first wrested it from
the Spaniard who wore it.[88] All the Papal influence was exerted to get
money for the expenses of the descent on Sicily. Even churchmen were
required to contribute, for it was a holy war, and the hope was that
when Charles, the champion of the Church, had reduced Italy to
obedience, won Sicily for himself by arms, and perhaps the Eastern
Empire by marriage, he would win the Holy Sepulchre for Christendom.

Charles crossed the Alps in August 1301, with five hundred men-at-arms,
and, avoiding Florence on his southward march, found Boniface at his
favourite residence of Anagni. He was created Pacificator of Tuscany,
and loaded with other honours. What better served the purpose of his
ambition, he was urged to retrace his steps and justify his new title by
restoring peace to Florence. There the Whites were still in power, but
they dared not declare themselves openly hostile to the Papal and Guelf
interest by refusing him admission to the city. He came with gentle
words, and ready to take the most stringent oaths not to tamper with the
liberties of the Commonwealth; but once he had gained an entrance
(November 1301) and secured his hold on Florence, he threw off every
disguise, gave full play to his avarice, and amused himself with looking
on at the pillage of the dwellings and warehouses of the Whites by the
party of Corso Donati. By all this, says Dante, Charles 'gained no
land,' Lackland as he was, 'but only sin and shame.'[89]

There is a want of precise information as to the events of this time.
But it seems probable that Dante formed one of an embassy sent by the
rulers of Florence to the Pope in the autumn of this year; and that on
the occasion of the entrance of Charles he was absent from Florence.
What the embassy had to propose which Boniface could be expected to be
satisfied with, short of complete submission, is not known and is not
easy to guess. It seems clear at least that Dante cannot have been
chosen as a person likely to be specially pleasing to the Roman Court.
Within the two years preceding he had made himself prominent in the
various Councils of which he was a member, by his sturdy opposition to
affording aid to the Pope in his Romagnese wars. It is even possible
that his theory of the Empire was already more or less known to
Boniface, and as that Pontiff claimed Imperial authority over such
states as Florence, this would be sufficient to secure him a rough
reception.[90] Where he was when the terrible news came to him that for
some days there had been no law in Florence, and that Corso Donati was
sharing in the triumph of Charles, we do not know. Presageful of worse
things to come, he did not seek to return, and is said to have been in
Siena when he heard that, on the 27th January 1302, he had been
sentenced to a heavy fine and political disabilities for having been
guilty of extortion while a Prior, of opposing the coming of Charles,
and of crimes against the peace of Florence and the interest of the
_Parte Guelfa_. If the fine was not paid within three days his goods and
property were to be confiscated. This condemnation he shared with three
others. In the following March he was one of twelve condemned, for
contumacy, to be burned alive if ever they fell into the hands of the
Florentine authorities. We may perhaps assume that the cruel sentence,
as well as the charge of peculation, was uttered only in order to
conform to some respectable precedents.


V.

Besides Dante many other Whites had been expelled from Florence.[91]
Whether they liked it or not, they were forced to seek aid from the
Ghibelines of Arezzo and Romagna. This led naturally to a change of
political views, and though at the time of their banishment all of them
were Guelfs in various degrees, as months and years went on they
developed into Ghibelines, more or less declared. Dissensions, too,
would be bred among them out of recriminations touching the past, and
charges of deserting the general interest for the sake of securing
private advantage in the way of making peace with the Republic. For a
time, however, the common desire of gaining a return to Florence held
them together. Of the Council constituted to bring this about, Dante was
a member. Once only with his associates does he appear to have come the
length of formal negotiations with a view to getting back. Charles of
Valois had passed away from the temporary scene of his extortions and
treachery, upon the futile quest of a crown. Boniface, ere being
persecuted to death by his old ally, Philip of France (1303), had vainly
attempted to check the cruelty of the Blacks; and Benedict, his
successor, sent the Cardinal of Ostia to Florence with powers to
reconcile the two parties. Dante is usually credited with the
composition of the letter in which Vieri dei Cerchi and his
fellow-exiles answered the call of the Cardinal to discuss the
conditions of their return home. All that had been done by the banished
party, said the letter, had been done for the public good.[92] The
negotiations came to nothing; nor were the exiles more fortunate in
arms. Along with their allies they did once succeed by a sudden dash in
penetrating to the market-place, and Florence lay within their grasp
when, seized with panic, they turned and fled from the city, which many
of them were never to see again.

Almost certainly Dante took no active part in this attempt, and indeed
there is little to show that he was ever heartily associated with the
exiles. In his own words, he was compelled to break with his companions
owing to their imbecility and wickedness, and to form a party by
himself.[93] With the Whites, then, he had little more to do; and the
story of their fortunes need not longer detain us. It is enough to say
that while, like Dante, the chief men among them were for ever excluded
from Florence, the principles for which they had contended survived, and
even obtained something like a triumph within its walls. The success of
Donati and his party, though won with the help of the people, was too
clearly opposed to the popular interest to be permanent. Ere long the
inveterate contradiction between magnate and merchant was again to
change the course of Florentine politics; the disabilities against
lawless nobles were again to be enforced; and Corso Donati himself was
to be crushed in the collision of passions he had evoked but could not
control (1308). Though tenderly attached to members of his family, Dante
bore Corso a grudge as having been the chief agent in procuring his
exile--a grudge which years could do nothing to wipe out. He places in
the mouth of Forese Donati a prophecy of the great Baron's shameful
death, expressed in curt and scornful words, terrible from a
brother.[94] It is no figure of speech to say that Dante nursed revenge.

For some few years his hopes were set on Henry of Luxemburg, elected
Emperor in 1308. A Ghibeline, in the ordinary sense of the term, Dante
never was. We have in his _De Monarchia_ a full account of the
conception he had formed of the Empire--that of authority in temporal
affairs embodied in a just ruler, who, being already supreme, would be
delivered from all personal ambition; who should decree justice and be a
refuge for all that were oppressed. He was to be the captain of
Christian society and the guardian of civil right; as in another sphere
the Pope was to be the shepherd of souls and the guardian of the deposit
of Divine truth. In Dante's eyes the one great officer was as much God's
vicegerent as the other. While the most that a Ghibeline or a moderate
Guelf would concede was that there should be a division of power between
Pope and Emperor--the Ghibeline leaving it to the Emperor and the Guelf
to the Pope to define their provinces--Dante held, and in this he stood
almost alone among politicians, that they ought to be concerned with
wholly different kingdoms, and that Christendom was wronged by the
trespass of either upon the other's domain. An equal wrong was done by
the neglect by either of his duty, and both, as Dante judged, had been
shamefully neglecting it. For more than half a century no Emperor had
set foot in Italy; and since the Papal Court had under Clement V. been
removed to Avignon (1305), the Pope had ceased to be a free agent, owing
to his neighbourhood to France and the unscrupulous Philip.[95]

Dante trusted that the virtuous single-minded Henry VII. would prove a
monarch round whom all the best in Italy might gather to make him
Emperor in deed as well as in name. His judgment took the colour of his
hopes, for under the awful shadow of the Emperor he trusted to enter
Florence. Although no Ghibeline or Imperialist in the vulgar sense, he
constituted himself Henry's apologist and herald; and in letters
addressed to the 'wicked Florentines,' to the Emperor, and to the
Princes and Peoples of Italy, he blew as it were a trumpet-blast of
triumph over the Emperor's enemies and his own. Henry had crossed the
Alps, and was tarrying in the north of Italy, when Dante, with a keen
eye for where the key of the situation lay, sharpened by his own wishes,
urged him to lose no more time in reducing the Lombard cities to
obedience, but to descend on Florence, the rotten sheep which was
corrupting all the Italian flock. The men of Florence he bids prepare to
receive the just reward of their crimes.

The Florentines answered Dante's bitter invective and the Emperor's
milder promises by an unwearied opposition with the arms which their
increasing command of all that tends to soften life made them now less
willing to take up, and by the diplomacy in which they were supreme The
exiles were recalled, always excepting the more stubborn or dangerous;
and among these was reckoned Dante. Alliances were made on all hands, an
art which Henry was notably wanting in the trick of. Wherever he turned
he was met and checkmated by the Florentines, who, wise by experience,
were set on retaining control of their own affairs. After his coronation
at Rome (1312),[96] he marched northwards, and with his Pisan and
Aretine allies for six weeks laid fruitless siege to Florence. King
Robert of Naples, whose aid he had hoped to gain by means of a family
alliance, was joined to the league of Guelfs, and Henry passed away from
Florence to engage in an enterprise against the Southern Kingdom, a
design cut short by his death (1313). He was the last Emperor that ever
sought to take the part in Italian affairs which on Dante's theory
belonged to the Imperial office. Well-meaning but weak, he was not the
man to succeed in reducing to practice a scheme of government which had
broken down even in the strong hands of the two Fredericks, and ere the
Commonwealths of Italy had become each as powerful as a Northern
kingdom. To explain his failure, Dante finds that his descent into Italy
was unseasonable: he came too soon. Rather, it may be said, he came far
too late.[97]

When, on the death of Henry, Dante was disappointed in his hopes of a
true revival of the Empire, he devoted himself for a time to urging the
restoration of the Papal Court to Rome, so that Italy might at least not
be left without some centre of authority. In a letter addressed to the
Italian Cardinals, he besought them to replace Clement V., who died in
1314,[98] by an Italian Pope. Why should they, he asked, resign this
great office into Gascon hands? Why should Rome, the true centre of
Christendom, be left deserted and despised? His appeal was fruitless, as
indeed it could not fail to be with only six Italian Cardinals in a
College of twenty-four; and after a vacancy of two years the Gascon
Clement was succeeded by another Gascon. Although Dante's motives in
making this attempt were doubtless as purely patriotic as those which
inspired Catherine of Siena to similar action a century later, he met,
we may be sure, with but little sympathy from his former
fellow-citizens. They were intent upon the interests of Florence alone,
and even of these they may sometimes have taken a narrow view. His was
the wider patriotism of the Italian, and it was the whole Peninsula
that he longed to see delivered from French influence and once more
provided with a seat of authority in its midst, even if it were only
that of spiritual power. The Florentines for their part, desirous of
security against the incursions of the northern horde, were rather set
on retaining the goodwill of France than on enjoying the neighbourhood
of the Pope. In this they were guilty of no desertion of their
principles. Their Guelfism had never been more than a mode of minding
themselves.

For about three years (1313-1316) the most dangerous foe of Florence was
Uguccione de la Faggiuola, a partisan Ghibeline chief, sprung from the
mountain-land of Urbino, which lies between Tuscany and Romagna. He made
himself lord of Pisa and Lucca, and defeated the Florentines and their
allies in the great battle of Montecatini (1315). To him Dante is
believed to have attached himself.[99] It would be easy for the Republic
to form an exaggerated idea of the part which the exile had in shaping
the policy or contributing to the success of his patron; and we are not
surprised to find that, although Dante's fighting days were done, he was
after the defeat subjected to a third condemnation (November 1315). If
caught, he was to lose his head; and his sons, or some of them, were
threatened with the same fate. The terms of the sentence may again have
been more severe than the intentions of those who uttered it. However
this may be, an amnesty was passed in the course of the following year,
and Dante was urged to take advantage of it. He found the conditions of
pardon too humiliating. Like a malefactor he would require to walk,
taper in hand and a shameful mitre on his head, to the church of St
John, and there make an oblation for his crimes. It was not in this
fashion that in his more hopeful hours the exile had imagined his
restoration. If ever he trod again the pavement of his beautiful St
John's, it was to be proudly, as a patriot touching whom his country had
confessed her sins; or, with a poet's more bashful pride, to receive the
laurel crown beside the font in which he was baptized. But as he would
not enter his well beloved, well hated Florence on the terms imposed by
his enemies, so he never had the chance of entering it on his own. The
spirit in which he, as it were, turned from the open gates of his native
town is well expressed in a letter to a friend, who would seem to have
been a churchman who had tried to win his compliance with the terms of
the pardon. After thanking his correspondent for his kindly eagerness to
recover him, and referring to the submission required, he says:--'And is
it in this glorious fashion that Dante Alighieri, wearied with an almost
trilustral exile, is recalled to his country? Is this the desert of an
innocence known to all, and of laborious study which for long has kept
him asweat?... But, Father, this is no way for me to return to my
country by; though if by you or others one can be hit upon through which
the honour and fame of Dante will take no hurt, it shall be followed by
me with no tardy steps. If by none such Florence is to be entered, I
will never enter Florence. What then! Can I not, wherever I may be,
behold the sun and stars? Is not meditation upon the sweetness of truth
as free to me in one place as another? To enjoy this, no need to submit
myself ingloriously and with ignominy to the State and People of
Florence! And wherever I may be thrown, in any case I trust at least to
find daily bread.'

The cruelty and injustice of Florence to her greatest son have been the
subject of much eloquent blame. But, in justice to his contemporaries,
we must try to see Dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the very
qualities fame makes so much of--his fervent temper and devotion to
great ideas--placed him out of the reach of common sympathy. Others
besides him had been banished from Florence, with as much or as little
reason, and had known the saltness of bread which has been begged, and
the steepness of strange stairs. The pains of banishment made them the
more eager to have it brought to a close. With Dante all that he
suffered went to swell the count of grievances for which a reckoning was
some day to be exacted. The art of returning was, as he himself knew
well, one he was slow to learn.[100] His noble obstinacy, which would
stoop to no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite our
admiration; it also goes far to account for his difficulty in getting
back. We can even imagine that in Florence his refusal to abate one
tittle of what was due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, the
subject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere they turned again
to their everyday affairs of politics and merchandise. Had they been
more used to deal with men in whom a great genius was allied to a
stubborn sense of honour, they would certainly have left less room in
their treatment of Dante for happier ages to cavil at.

How did the case stand? In the letter above quoted from, Dante says that
his innocence was known to all. As far as the charge of corruption in
his office-bearing went, his banishment--no one can doubt it for a
moment--was certainly unjust; and the political changes in Florence
since the death of Corso Donati had taken all the life out of the other
charges. But by his eager appeals to the Emperor to chastise the
Florentines he had raised fresh barriers against his return. The
governors of the Republic could not be expected to adopt his theory of
the Empire and share his views of the Imperial claims; and to them Dante
must have seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the Commonwealth in
inviting the presence of Henry, as Corso Donati had been in Dante's eyes
for his share in bringing Charles of Valois to harry Florence. His
political writings since his exile--and all his writings were more or
less political--had been such as might well confirm or create an opinion
of him as a man difficult to live with, as one whose intellectual
arrogance had a ready organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. Rumour
would most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of his
character and conduct that separated him from the common herd. And to
add to all this, even after he had deserted the party of the Whites in
exile, and had become a party to himself, he found his friends and
patrons--for where else could he find them?--among the foes of Florence.


VI.

History never abhors a vacuum so much as when she has to deal with the
life of a great man, and for those who must have details of Dante's
career during the nineteen years which elapsed between his banishment
and his death, the industry of his biographers has exhausted every
available hint, while some of them press into their service much that
has only the remotest bearing on their hero. If even one-half of their
suppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the conclusion that
the _Comedy_ and all the other works of his exile were composed in the
intervals of a very busy life. We have his own word for this much,
(_Convito_ i. 3,) that since he was cast forth out of Florence--in which
he would 'fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his appointed time'--he
had been 'a pilgrim, nay, even a mendicant,' in every quarter of
Italy,[101] and had 'been held cheap by many who, because of his fame,
had looked to find him come in another guise.' But he gives no journal
of his wanderings, and, as will have been observed, says no word of any
country but Italy. Keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seems
established that in the earlier period of his exile he sojourned with
members of the great family of the Counts Guidi,[102] and that he also
found hospitality with the Malaspini,[103] lords of the Val di Magra,
between Genoa and Lucca. At a still earlier date (August 1306) he is
found witnessing a deed in Padua. It was most probably in the same year
that Dante found Giotto there, painting the walls of the Scrovegni
Chapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist, and taken to his
house.[104] At some time of his life he studied at Bologna: John Villani
says, during his exile.[105] Of his supposed residence in Paris, though
it is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit to England,
none at all that is worth a moment's consideration. Some of his
commentators and biographers seem to think he was so short-witted that
he must have been in a place before it could occur to him to name it in
his verse.

We have Dante's own word for it that he found his exile almost
intolerable. Besides the bitter resentment which he felt at the
injustice of it, he probably cherished the conviction that his career
had been cut short when he was on the point of acquiring great influence
in affairs. The illusion may have been his--one not uncommon among men
of a powerful imagination--that, given only due opportunity, he could
mould the active life of his time as easily as he moulded and fashioned
the creations of his fancy. It was, perhaps, owing to no fault of his
own that when a partial opportunity had offered itself, he failed to get
his views adopted in Florence; indeed, to judge from the kind of
employment in which he was more than once engaged for his patrons, he
must have been possessed of no little business tact. Yet, as when his
feelings were deeply concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopes
would partake of the largeness of his genius. In the restored Empire,
which he was almost alone in longing for as he conceived of it, he may
have imagined for himself a place beside Henry like what in Frederick's
court had been filled by Pier delle Vigne--the man who held both keys to
the Emperor's heart, and opened and shut it as he would.[106]

Thus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with the accumulating
memories of hopes deferred and then destroyed, and of dreams which had
faded away in the light of a cheerless reality. But some consolations he
must have found even in the conditions of his exile. He had leisure for
meditation, and time enough to spend in that other world which was all
his own. With the miseries of a wanderer's life would come not a few of
its sweets--freedom from routine, and the intellectual stimulus supplied
by change of place. Here and there he would find society such as he
cared for--that of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with every
court and school of Christendom. And, beyond all, he would get access to
books that at home he might never have seen. It was no spare diet that
would serve his mind while he was making such ample calls on it for his
great work. As it proceeds we seem to detect a growing fulness of
knowledge, and it is by reason of the more learned treatment, as well as
the loftier theme of the Third Cantica, that so many readers, when once
well at sea in the _Paradiso_, recognise the force of the warning with
which it begins.[107]

What amount of intercourse he was able to maintain with Florence during
his wanderings is a matter of mere speculation, although of a more
interesting kind than that concerned with the chronology of his uneasy
travels. That he kept up at least some correspondence with his friends
is proved by the letter regarding the terms of his pardon. There is also
the well-known anecdote told by Boccaccio as to the discovery and
despatch to him of the opening Cantos of the _Inferno_--an anecdote we
may safely accept as founded on fact, although Boccaccio's informants
may have failed to note at the time what the manuscript consisted of,
and in the course of years may have magnified the importance of their
discovery. With his wife he would naturally communicate on subjects of
common interest--as, for instance, that of how best to save or recover
part of his property--and especially regarding the welfare of his sons,
of whom two are found to be with him when he acquires something like a
settlement in Verona.

It is quite credible that, as Boccaccio asserts, he would never after
his exile was once begun 'go to his wife or suffer her to join him where
he was;' although the statement is probably an extension of the fact
that she never did join him. In any case it is to make too large a use
of the words to find in them evidence, as has frequently been done, of
the unhappiness of all his married life, and of his utter estrangement
from Gemma during his banishment. The union--marriage of convenience
though it was--might be harmonious enough as long as things went
moderately well with the pair. Dante was never wealthy, but he seems to
have had his own house in Florence and small landed possessions in its
neighbourhood.[108] That before his banishment he was considerably in
debt appears to be ascertained;[109] but, without knowing the
circumstances in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure whether
he may not only have been making use of his credit in order to put out
part of his means to advantage in some of the numerous commercial
enterprises in which his neighbours were engaged. In any case his career
must have seemed full of promise till he was driven into banishment.
When that blow had fallen, it is easy to conceive how what if it was not
mutual affection had come to serve instead of it--esteem and
forbearance--would be changed into indifference with the lapse of months
and years of enforced separation, embittered and filled on both sides
with the mean cares of indigence, and, it may be, on Gemma's side with
the conviction that her husband had brought her with himself into
disgrace. If all that is said by Boccaccio and some of Dante's enemies
as to his temperament and behaviour were true, we could only hope that
Gemma's indifference was deep enough to save her from the pangs of
jealousy. And on the other hand, if we are to push suspicion to its
utmost length, we may find an allusion to his own experience in the
lines where Dante complains of how soon a widow forgets her
husband.[110] But this is all matter of the merest speculation. Gemma
is known to have been alive in 1314.[111] She brought up her children,
says Boccaccio, upon a trifling part of her husband's confiscated
estate, recovered on the plea that it was a portion of her dowry. There
may have been difficulties of a material kind, insuperable save to an
ardent love that was not theirs, in the way of Gemma's joining her
husband in any of his cities of refuge.

Complete evidence exists of Dante's having in his later years lived for
a longer or shorter time in the three cities of Lucca, Verona, and
Ravenna. In Purgatory he meets a shade from Lucca, in the murmur of
whose words he catches he 'knows not what of Gentucca;'[112] and when he
charges the Lucchese to speak plainly out, he is told that Lucca shall
yet be found pleasant by him because of a girl not yet grown to
womanhood. Uguccione, acting in the interest of Pisa, took possession of
Lucca in 1314, and Dante is supposed to have taken up his residence
there for some considerable time. What we may certainly infer from his
own words in the _Purgatorio_ is that they were written after a stay in
Lucca had been sweetened to him by the society of a lady named Gentucca.
He cannot well have found shelter there before the city was held by
Uguccione; and research has established that at least two ladies of the
uncommon name of Gentucca were resident there in 1314. From the whole
tone of his allusion--the mention of her very name and of her innocent
girlhood--we may gather that there was nothing in his liking for her of
which he had any reason to feel ashamed. In the _Inferno_ he had covered
the whole people of Lucca with his scorn.[113] By the time he got thus
far with the _Purgatorio_ his thoughts of the place were all softened by
his memory of one fair face--or shall we rather say, of one
compassionate and womanly soul? That Dante was more than susceptible to
feminine charms is coarsely asserted by Boccaccio.[114] But on such a
matter Boccaccio is a prejudiced witness, and, in the absence of
sufficient proof to the contrary, justice requires us to assume that the
tenor of Dante's life was not at variance with that of his writings. He
who was so severe a judge of others was not, as we can infer from more
than one passage of the _Comedy_, a lenient judge when his own failings
were concerned.[115] That his conduct never fell short of his standard
no one will venture to maintain. But what should have hindered him, in
his hours of weariness and when even his hold on the future seemed to
slacken, in lonely castle or strange town, to seek sympathy from some
fair woman who might remind him in something of Beatrice?[116]

When, in 1316, Uguccione was driven out of Lucca and Pisa, that great
partisan took military service with Can Grande. It has been disputed
whether Dante had earlier enjoyed the hospitality of the Scaligers, or
was indebted for his first reception in Verona to the good offices of
Uguccione. It is barely credible that by this time in his life he stood
in need of any one to answer for him in the court of Can Grande. His
fame as a political writer must have preceded him; and it was of a
character to commend him to the good graces of the great Imperialist. In
his _De Monarchia_ he had, by an exhaustive treatment of propositions
which now seem childish or else the mere commonplaces of everyday
political argument, established the right of the civil power to
independence of Church authority; and though to the Scaliger who aimed
at becoming Imperial lieutenant for all the North of Italy he might seem
needlessly tender to the spiritual lordship of the Holy Father, yet the
drift of his reasoning was all in favour of the Ghibeline position.[117]
Besides this he had written on the need of refining the dialects of
Italian, and reducing them to a language fit for general use in the
whole of the Peninsula; and this with a novelty of treatment and wealth
of illustration unequalled before or since in any first work on such a
subject.[118] And, what would recommend him still more to a youthful
prince of lofty taste, he was the poet of the 'sweet new style' of the
_Vita Nuova_, and of sonnets, ballads, and canzoni rich in language and
thought beyond the works of all previous poets in the vulgar tongues.
Add to this that the _Comedy_ was already written, and published up,
perhaps, to the close of the _Purgatorio_, and that all Italy was eager
to find who had a place, and what kind of place, in the strange new
world from which the veil was being withdrawn; and it is easy to imagine
that Dante's reception at Can Grande's court was rather that of a man
both admired and feared for his great genius, than that of a wandering
scholar and grumbling exile.

At what time Dante came to Verona, and for how long he stayed, we have
no means of fixing with certainty. He himself mentions being there in
1320,[119] and it is usually supposed that his residence covered three
years previous to that date; as also that it was shared by his two sons,
Piero and Jacopo. One of these was afterwards to find a settlement at
Verona in a high legal post. Except some frivolous legends, there is no
evidence that Dante met with anything but generous treatment from Can
Grande. A passage of the _Paradiso_, written either towards the close of
the poet's residence at Verona, or after he had left it, is full of a
praise of the great Scaliger so magnificent[120] as fully to make amends
for the contemptuous mention in the _Purgatorio_ of his father and
brother.[121] To Can Grande the _Paradiso_ was dedicated by the author
in a long epistle containing an exposition of how the first Canto of
that Cantica, and, by implication, the whole of the poem, is to be
interpreted. The letter is full of gratitude for favours already
received, and of expectation of others yet to come. From the terms of
the dedication it has been assumed that ere it was made the whole of the
_Paradiso_ was written, and that Dante praises the lord of Verona after
a long experience of his bounty.[122]

Whether owing to the restlessness of an exile, or to some prospect of
attaining a state of greater ease or of having the command of more
congenial society, we cannot tell; but from the splendid court of Can
Grande he moved down into Romagna, to Ravenna, the city which of all in
Italy would now be fixed upon by the traveller as the fittest place for
a man of genius, weighed down by infinite sorrows, to close his days in
and find a tomb. Some writers on the life of Dante will have it that in
Ravenna he spent the greater part of his exile, and that when he is
found elsewhere--in Lucca or Verona--he is only on a temporary absence
from his permanent home.[123] But this conclusion requires some facts to
be ignored, and others unduly dwelt on. In any case his patron there,
during at least the last year or two of his life, was Guido Novello of
Polenta, lord of Ravenna, the nephew of her who above all the persons of
the _Comedy_ lives in the hearts of its readers.

Bernardino, the brother of Francesca and uncle of Guido, had fought on
the side of Florence at the battle of Campaldino, and Dante may then
have become acquainted with him. The family had the reputation of being
moderate Guelfs; but ere this the exile, with his ripe experience of
men, had doubtless learned, while retaining intact his own opinions as
to what was the true theory of government, to set good-heartedness and
a noble aim in life above political orthodoxy. This Guido Novello--the
younger Guido--bears the reputation of having been well-informed, of
gentle manners, and fond of gathering around him men accomplished in
literature and the fine arts. On the death of Dante he made a formal
oration in honour of the poet. If his welcome of Dante was as cordial as
is generally supposed, and as there is no reason to doubt that it was,
it proved his magnanimity; for in the _Purgatorio_ a family specially
hostile to the Polentas had been mentioned with honour,[124] while that
to which his wife belonged had been lightly spoken of. How he got over
the condemnation of his kinswoman to Inferno--even under such gentle
conditions--it would be more difficult to understand were there not
reason to believe that ere Dante went to Ravenna it had come to be a
matter of pride in Italy for a family to have any of its members placed
anywhere in that other world of which Dante held the key.

It seems as if we might assume that the poet's last months or years were
soothed by the society of his daughter--the child whom he had named
after the object of his first and most enduring love.[125] Whether or
not he was acting as Ambassador for Guido to Venice when he caught his
last illness, it appears to be pretty well established that he was held
in honour by his patron and all around him.[126] For his hours of
meditation he had the solemn churches of Ravenna with their storied
walls,[127] and the still more solemn pine forest of Classis, by him
first annexed to the world of Romance.[128] For hours of relaxation,
when they came, he had neighbours who dabbled in letters and who could
at any rate sympathise with him in his love of study. He maintained
correspondence with poets and scholars in other cities. In at least one
instance this was conducted in the bitter fashion with which the
humanists of a century or two later were to make the world
familiar;[129] but with the Bolognese scholar, Giovanni del Virgilio, he
engaged in a good-humoured, half-bantering exchange of Latin pastoral
poems, through the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks a
natural thought, as when in answer to the pedant's counsel to renounce
the vulgar tongue and produce in Latin something that will entitle him
to receive the laurel crown in Bologna, he declares that if ever he is
crowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the Arno.

Most of the material for forming a judgment of how Dante stood affected
to the religious beliefs of his time is to be gathered from the
_Comedy_, and the place for considering it would rather be in an essay
on that work than in a sketch of his life which necessity compels to be
swift. A few words may however be here devoted to the subject, as it is
one with some bearing on the manner in which he would be regarded by
those around him, and through that on the tenor of his life. That Dante
conformed to Church observances, and, except with a few malevolent
critics, bore the reputation of a good Catholic, there can be no doubt.
It was as a politician and not as a heretic that he suffered
persecution; and when he died he was buried in great honour within the
Franciscan Church at Ravenna. Some few years after his death, it is
true, his _De Monarchia_ was burned as heretical by orders of the Papal
Legate in Lombardy, who would gladly, if he could, have had the bones of
the author exhumed to share the fate of his book. But all this was only
because the partisans of Lewis of Bavaria were making political capital
out of the treatise.

Attempts have been made to demonstrate that in spite of his outward
conformity Dante was an unbeliever at heart, and that the _Comedy_ is
devoted to the promulgation of a Ghibeline heresy--of which, we may be
sure, no Ghibeline ever heard--and to the overthrow of all that the
author professed most devoutly to believe.[130] Other critics of a more
sober temper in speculation would find in him a Catholic who held the
Catholic beliefs with the same slack grasp as the teaching of Luther was
held by Lessing or Goethe.[131] But this is surely to misread the
_Comedy_, which is steeped from beginning to end in a spirit of the
warmest faith in the great Christian doctrines. It was no mere
intellectual perception of these that Dante had--or professed to
have--for when in Paradise he has satisfied Saint Peter of his being
possessed of a just conception of the nature of faith, and is next asked
if, besides knowing what is the alloy of the coin and the weight of it,
he has it in his own purse, he answers boldly, 'Yea, and so shining and
round that of a surety it has the lawful stamp.'[132] And further on,
when required to declare in what he believes, nothing against the
fulness of his creed is to be inferred from the fact that he stops short
after pronouncing his belief in the existence of God and in the Trinity.
This article he gives as implying all the others; it is 'the spark which
spreads out into a vivid flame.'[133]

Yet if the inquiry were to be pushed further, and it were sought to find
how much of free thought he allowed himself in matters of religion,
Dante might be discovered to have reached his orthodox position by ways
hateful to the bigots who then took order for preserving the purity of
the faith. The office of the Pope he deeply revered, but the Papal
absolution avails nothing in his eyes compared with one tear of
heartfelt repentance.[134] It is not on the word of Pope or Council that
he rests his faith, but on the Scriptures, and on the evidences of the
truth of Christianity, freely examined and weighed.[135] Chief among
these evidences, it must however be noted, he esteemed the fact of the
existence of the Church as he found it;[136] and in his inquiries he
accepted as guides the Scholastic Doctors on whose reasonings the Church
had set its seal of approbation. It was a foregone conclusion he reached
by stages of his own. Yet that he sympathised at least as much with the
honest search for truth as with the arrogant profession of orthodoxy, is
shown by his treatment of heretics. He could not condemn severely such
as erred only because their reason would not consent to rest like his in
the prevalent dogmatic system; and so we find that he makes heresy
consist less in intellectual error than in beliefs that tend to vitiate
conduct, or to cause schism in societies divinely constituted.[137] For
his own part, orthodox although he was, or believed himself to be--which
is all that needs to be contended for,--in no sense was he
priest-ridden. It was liberty that he went seeking on his great
journey;[138] and he gives no hint that it is to be gained by the
observance of forms or in submission to sacerdotal authority. He knows
it is in his reach only when he has been crowned, and mitred too, lord
of himself[139]--subject to Him alone of whom even Popes were
servants.[140]

Although in what were to prove his last months Dante might amuse himself
with the composition of learned trifles, and in the society and
correspondence of men who along with him, if on lines apart from his,
were preparing the way for the revival of classical studies, the best
part of his mind, then as for long before, was devoted to the _Comedy_;
and he was counting on the suffrages of a wider audience than courts and
universities could supply.

Here there is no room to treat at length of that work, to which when we
turn our thoughts all else he wrote--though that was enough to secure
him fame--seems to fall into the background as if unworthy of his
genius. What can hardly be passed over in silence is that in the
_Comedy_, once it was begun, he must have found a refuge for his soul
from all petty cares, and a shield against all adverse fortune. We must
search its pages, and not the meagre records of his biographers, to find
what was the life he lived during the years of his exile; for, in a
sense, it contains the true journal of his thoughts, of his hopes, and
of his sorrows. The plan was laid wide enough to embrace the
observations he made of nature and of man, the fruits of his painful
studies, and the intelligence he gathered from those experienced in
travel, politics, and war. It was not only his imagination and artistic
skill that were spent upon the poem: he gave his life to it. The future
reward he knew was sure--an immortal fame; but he hoped for a nearer
profit on his venture. Florence might at last relent, if not because of
his innocence and at the spectacle of his inconsolable exile, at least
on hearing the rumour of his genius borne to her from every corner of
Italy:--

  If e'er it comes that this my sacred Lay,
    To which both Heaven and Earth have set their hand--
    Through which these many years I waste away--
  Shall quell the cruelty that keeps me banned
    From the fair fold where I, a lamb, was found
    Hostile to wolves who 'gainst it violence planned;
  With other fleece and voice of other sound,
    Poet will I return, and at the font
    Where I was christened be with laurel crowned.[141]

But with the completion of the _Comedy_ Dante's life too came to a
close. He died at Ravenna in the month of September 1321.

[2] Whether by Matilda the great Countess is meant has been eagerly
disputed, and many of the best critics--such as Witte and
Scartazzini--prefer to find in her one of the ladies of the _Vita
Nuova_. In spite of their pains it seems as if more can be said for the
great Matilda than for any other. The one strong argument against her
is, that while she died old, in the poem she appears as young.

[11] Villani throws doubt on the guilt of the Abbot. There were some
cases of churchmen being Ghibelines, as for instance that of the
Cardinal Ubaldini (_Inf._ x. 120). Twenty years before the Abbot's death
the General of the Franciscans had been jeered at in the streets of
Florence for turning his coat and joining the Emperor. On the other
hand, many civilians were to be found among the Guelfs.

[12] Manfred, says John Villani (_Cronica_, vi. 74 and 75), at first
sent only a hundred men. Having by Farinata's advice been filled with
wine before a skirmish in which they were induced to engage, they were
easily cut in pieces by the Florentines; and the royal standard was
dragged in the dust. The truth of the story matters less than that it
was believed in Florence.

[13] Provenzano is found by Dante in Purgatory, which he has been
admitted to, in spite of his sins, because of his self-sacrificing
devotion to a friend (_Purg._ xi. 121).

[14] For this good advice he gets a word of praise in Inferno (_Inf._

[35] It opens with Brunetto's being lost in the forest of Roncesvalles,
and there are some other features of resemblance--all on the
surface--between his experience and Dante's.

[36] G. Villani, viii. 10. Latini died in 1294. Villani gives the old
scholar a very bad moral character.

[38] We may, I think, assume the _Vita Nuova_ to have been published
some time between 1291 and 1300; but the dates of Dante's works are far
from being ascertained.

[39] So long as even Italian critics are not agreed as to whether the
title means _New Life_, or _Youth_, I suppose one is free to take his
choice; and it seems most natural to regard it as referring to the new
world into which the lover is transported by his passion.

[40] As, indeed, Boccaccio, _Vita di Dante_, expressly says was the
case.

[41] In this adopting a device frequently used by the love-poets of the
period.--Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 312.

[42] The _Vita Nuova_ contains some thirty poems.

[43] See Sir Theodore Martin's Introduction to his Translation of _Vita
Nuova_, page xxi.

[44] In this matter we must not judge the conduct of Dante by English
customs.

[45] _Donne, ch' avete intelletto d' amore_: Ladies that are acquainted
well with love. Quoted in _Purg._ xxiv. 51.

[46] Beatrice died in June 1290, having been born in April 1266.

[47] _Purg._ xi. 98.

[48] _Purg._ xxiv. 52.

[49] The date of the _Convito_ is still the subject of controversy, as
is that of most of Dante's works. But it certainly was composed between
the _Vita Nuova_ and the _Comedy_.

There is a remarkable sonnet by Guido Cavalcanti addressed to Dante,
reproaching him for the deterioration in his thoughts and habits, and
urging him to rid himself of the woman who has bred the trouble. This
may refer to the time after the death of Beatrice. See also _Purg._ xxx.
124.

[50] _Convito_ ii. 13.

[51] Some recent writers set his marriage five years later, and reduce
the number of his children to three.

[52] His sister is probably meant by the 'young and gentle lady, most
nearly related to him by blood' mentioned in the _Vita Nuova_.

[53] The difference between the Teutonic and Southern conception of
marriage must be kept in mind.

[54] He describes the weather on the day of the battle with the
exactness of one who had been there (_Purg._ v. 155).

[58] _Conv._ iii. 9, where he illustrates what he has to say about the
nature of vision, by telling that for some time the stars, when he
looked at them, seemed lost in a pearly haze.

[59] The _Convito_ was to have consisted of fifteen books. Only four
were written.

[60] _Wife of Bath's Tale._ In the context he quotes _Purg._ vii. 121,

[68] Sacchetti's stories of how Dante showed displeasure with the
blacksmith and the donkey-driver who murdered his _canzoni_ are
interesting only as showing what kind of legends about him were current
in the streets of Florence.--Sacchetti, _Novelle_, cxiv, cxv.

[69] _Purg._ xii. 101.

[70] _Purg._ xi. 94:--

        'In painting Cimabue deemed the field
        His own, but now on Giotto goes the cry,
        Till by his fame the other's is concealed.'

[71] Giotto is often said to have drawn inspiration from the _Comedy_;
but that Dante, on his side, was indebted to the new school of painting
and sculpture appears from many a passage of the _Purgatorio_.

[72] Serfage had been abolished in 1289. But doubt has been thrown on
the authenticity of the deed of abolition. See Perrens, _Hist. de
Florence_, vol. ii. p. 349.

[73] No unusual provision in the industrious Italian cities. Harsh
though it may seem, it was probably regarded as a valuable concession to
the nobles, for their disaffection appears to have been greatly caused
by their uneasiness under disabilities. There is much obscurity on
several points. How, for example, came the nobles to be allowed to
retain the command of the vast resources of the _Parte Guelfa_? This
made them almost independent of the Commonwealth.

[74] At a later period the Priors were known as the Signory.

[75] Fraticelli, _Storia della Vita di Dante_, page 112 and note.

[76] It is to be regretted that Ampère in his charming _Voyage
Dantesque_ devoted no chapter to San Gemigniano, than which no Tuscan
city has more thoroughly preserved its mediæval character. There is no
authority for the assertion that Dante was employed on several
Florentine embassies. The tendency of his early biographers is to
exaggerate his political importance and activity.

[77] Under the date of April 1301 Dante is deputed by the Road Committee
to see to the widening, levelling, and general improvement of a street
in the suburbs.--Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 279.

[78] Dante has a word of praise for Giano, at _Parad._ xvi. 127.

[79] At which Dante fought. See page lxii.

[80] Vieri was called Messer, a title reserved for magnates, knights,
and lawyers of a certain rank--notaries and jurisconsults; Dante, for
example, never gets it.

[81] Villani acted for some time as an agent abroad of the great
business house of Peruzzi.

[83] He is 'the Prince of the modern Pharisees' (_Inf._ xxvii. 85); his
place is ready for him in hell (_Inf._ xix. 53); and he is elsewhere
frequently referred to. In one great passage Dante seems to relent
towards him (_Purg._ xx. 86).

[84] Albert of Hapsburg was chosen Emperor in 1298, but was never
crowned at Rome.

[85] As in the days of Guelf and Ghibeline, so now in those of Blacks
and Whites, the common multitude of townsmen belonged to neither party.

[86] An interdict means that priests are to refuse sacred offices to all
in the community, who are thus virtually subjected to the minor
excommunication.

[87] Guido died soon after his return in 1301. He had suffered in health
during his exile. See _Inf._ x. 63.

[88] Charles of Anjou had lost Sicily at the Sicilian Vespers, 1282.

[89] _Purg._ xx. 76.

[90] Witte attributes the composition of the _De Monarchia_ to a period
before 1301 (_Dante-Forschungen_, vol. i. Fourth Art.), but the general
opinion of critics sets it much later.

[91] _Inf._ vi. 66, where their expulsion is prophesied.

[92] Dante's authorship of the letter is now much questioned. The drift
of recent inquiries has been rather to lessen than to swell the bulk of
materials for his biography.

[93] _Parad._ xvii. 61.

[94] _Purg._ xxiv. 82.

[95] See at _Purg._ xx. 43 Dante's invective against Philip and the
Capets in general.

[96] Henry had come to Italy with the Pope's approval. He was crowned by
the Cardinals who were in Rome as Legates.

[97] _Parad._ xxx. 136. High in Heaven Dante sees an ample chair with a
crown on it, and is told it is reserved for Henry. He is to sit among
those who are clothed in white. The date assigned to the action of the
_Comedy_, it will be remembered, is the year 1300.

[98] _Inf._ xix. 82, where the Gascon Clement is described as a 'Lawless
Pastor from the West.'

[99] The ingenious speculations of Troya (_Del Veltro Allegorico di
Dante_) will always mark a stage in the history of the study of Dante,
but as is often the case with books on the subject, his shows a
considerable gap between the evidence adduced and the conclusions drawn
from it. He would make Dante to have been for many years a satellite of
the great Ghibeline chief. Dante's temper or pride, however we call it,
seems to have been such as to preserve him from ever remaining attached
for long to any patron.

[100] _Inf._ x. 81.

[101] The _Convito_ is in Italian, and his words are: 'wherever this
language is spoken.'

[102] His letter to the Florentines and that to the Emperor are dated in
1311, from 'Near the sources of the Arno'--that is, from the Casentino,
where the Guidi of Romena dwelt. If the letter of condolence with the
Counts Oberto and Guido of Romena on the death of their uncle is
genuine, it has great value for the passage in which he excuses himself
for not having come to the funeral:--'It was not negligence or
ingratitude, but the poverty into which I am fallen by reason of my
exile. This, like a cruel persecutor, holds me as in a prison-house
where I have neither horse nor arms; and though I do all I can to free
myself, I have failed as yet.' The letter has no date. Like the other
ten or twelve epistles attributed to Dante, it is in Latin.

[103] There is a splendid passage in praise of this family, _Purg._
viii. 121. A treaty is on record in which Dante acts as representative
of the Malaspini in settling the terms of a peace between them and the
Bishop of Luni in October 1306.

[104] The authority for this is Benvenuto of Imola in his comment on the
_Comedy_ (_Purg._ xi.). The portrait of Dante by Giotto, still in
Florence, but ruined by modern bungling restoration, is usually believed
to have been executed in 1301 or 1302. But with regard to this, see the
note at the end of this essay.

[105] It is true that Villani not only says that 'he went to study at
Bologna,' but also that 'he went to Paris and many parts of the world'
(_Cronica_, ix. 136), and that Villani, of all contemporary or nearly
contemporary writers, is by far the most worthy of credence. But he
proves to be more than once in error regarding Dante; making him,
_e.g._, die in a wrong month and be buried in a wrong church at Ravenna.
And the 'many parts of the world' shows that here he is dealing in
hearsay of the vaguest sort. Nor can much weight be given to Boccaccio
when he sends Dante to Bologna and Paris. But Benvenuto of Imola, who
lectured on the _Comedy_ at Bologna within fifty years of Dante's death,
says that Dante studied there. It would indeed be strange if he did not,
and at more than one period, Bologna being the University nearest
Florence. Proof of Dante's residence in Paris has been found in his
familiar reference to the Rue du Fouarre (_Parad._ x. 137). His graphic
description of the coast between Lerici and Turbia (_Purg._ iii. 49, iv.
25) certainly seems to show a familiarity with the Western as well as
the Eastern Rivieras of Genoa. But it scarcely follows that he was on
his way to Paris when he visited them.

[106] _Inf._ xiii. 58.

[107] 'O ye, who have hitherto been following me in some small
craft, ... put not further to sea, lest, losing sight of me, you lose
yourselves' (_Parad._ ii. 1). But, to tell the truth, Dante is never so
weak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.
The following list of books more or less known to him is not given as
complete:--The Vulgate, beginning with St. Jerome's Prologue; Aristotle,
through the Latin translation then in vogue; Averroes, etc.; Thomas
Aquinas and the other Schoolmen; much of the Civil and Canon law;
Boethius; Homer only in scraps, through Aristotle, etc.; Virgil, Cicero
in part, Livy, Horace, Ovid, Terence, Lucan, and Statius; the works of
Brunetto Latini; the poetical literature of Provence, France, and Italy,
including the Arthurian Romances--the favourite reading of the Italian
nobles, and the tales of Charlemagne and his Peers--equally in favour
with the common people. There is little reason to suppose that among the
treatises of a scientific and quasi-scientific kind that he fell in
with, and of which he was an eager student, were included the works of
Roger Bacon. These there was a conspiracy among priests and schoolmen to
keep buried. Dante seems to have set little store on ecclesiastical
legends of wonder; at least he gives them a wide berth in his works.

[108] In the notes to Fraticelli's _Vita di Dante_ (Florence 1861) are
given copies of documents relating to the property of the Alighieri, and
of Dante in particular. In 1343 his son Jacopo, by payment of a small
fine, recovered vineyards and farms that had been his father's.--Notes
to Chap. iii. Fraticelli's admirable Life is now in many respects out of
date. He accepts, _e.g._, Dino Compagni as an authority, and believes in
the romantic story of the letter of Fra Ilario.

[109] The details are given by Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol ii. p.
61. The amount borrowed by Dante and his brother (and a friend) comes to
nearly a thousand gold florins. Witte takes this as equivalent to 37,000
francs, _i.e._ nearly £1500. But the florin being the eighth of an
ounce, or about ten shillings' worth of gold, a thousand florins would
be equal only to £500--representing, of course, an immensely greater sum
now-a-days.

[110] _Purg._ viii. 76.

[111] See in Scartazzini, _Dante Alighieri_, 1879, page 552, extract
from the will of her mother Maria Donati, dated February 1314. Many of
these Florentine dates are subject to correction, the year being usually
counted from Lady-Day. 'In 1880 a document was discovered which proves
Gemma to have been engaged in a law-suit in 1332.--_Il Propugnatore_,
xiii^a. 156,'--Scheffer-Boichorst, _Aus Dantes Verbannung_, page 213.

[112] _Purg._ xxiv. 37.

[113] _Inf._ xxi. 40.

[114] _In questo mirifico poeta trovò ampissimo luego la lussuria; e non
solamente ne' giovanili anni, ma ancora ne' maturi._--Boccaccio, _La
Vita di Dante_. After mentioning that Dante was married, he indulges in
a long invective against marriage; confessing, however, that he is
ignorant of whether Dante experienced the miseries he describes. His
conclusion on the subject is that philosophers should leave marriage to
rich fools, to nobles, and to handicraftsmen.

[115] In Purgatory his conscience accuses him of pride, and he already
seems to feel the weight of the grievous burden beneath which the proud
bend as they purge themselves of their sin (_Purg._ xiii. 136). Some
amount of self-accusation seems to be implied in such passages as
_Inf._, v. 142 and _Purg._ xxvii. 15, etc.; but too much must not be
made of it.

[116] In a letter of a few lines to one of the Marquises Malaspina,
written probably in the earlier years of his exile, he tells how his
purpose of renouncing ladies' society and the writing of love-songs had
been upset by the view of a lady of marvellous beauty who 'in all
respects answered to his tastes, habits, and circumstances.' He says he
sends with the letter a poem containing a fuller account of his
subjection to this new passion. The poem is not found attached to the
copy of the letter, but with good reason it is guessed to be the Canzone
beginning _Amor, dacchè convien_, which describes how he was
overmastered by a passion born 'in the heart of the mountains in the
valley of that river beside which he had always been the victim of
love.' This points to the Casentino as the scene. He also calls the
Canzone his 'mountain song.' The passion it expresses may be real, but
that he makes the most of it appears from the close, which is occupied
by the thought of how the verses will be taken in Florence.

[117] However early the _De Monarchia_ may have been written, it is
difficult to think that it can be of a later date than the death of
Henry.

[118] The _De Vulgari Eloquio_ is in Latin. Dante's own Italian is
richer and more elastic than that of contemporary writers. Its base is
the Tuscan dialect, as refined by the example of the Sicilian poets. His
Latin, on the contrary, is I believe regarded as being somewhat
barbarous, even for the period.

[119] In his _Quæstio de Aqua et Terra_. In it he speaks of having been
in Mantua. The thesis was maintained in Verona, but of course he may,
after a prolonged absence, have returned to that city.

[120] _Parad._ xvii. 70.

[121] _Purg._ xviii. 121.

[122] But in urgent need of more of it.--He says of 'the sublime
Cantica, adorned with the title of the _Paradiso_', that '_illam sub
præsenti epistola, tamquam sub epigrammate proprio dedicatam, vobis
adscribo, vobis offero, vobis denique recommendo_.' But it may be
questioned if this involves that the Cantica was already finished.

[123] As, for instance, Herr Scheffer-Boichorst in his _Aus Dantes
Verbannung_, 1882.

[124] The Traversari (_Purg._ xiv. 107). Guido's wife was of the
Bagnacavalli (_Purg._ xiv. 115). The only mention of the Polenta family,
apart from that of Francesca, is at _Inf._ xxvii. 41.

[125] In 1350 a sum of ten gold florins was sent from Florence by the
hands of Boccaccio to Beatrice, daughter of Dante; she being then a nun
at Ravenna.

[126] The embassy to Venice is mentioned by Villani, and there was a
treaty concluded in 1321 between the Republic and Guido. But Dante's
name does not appear in it among those of the envoys from Ravenna. A
letter, probably apocryphal, to Guido from Dante in Venice is dated
1314. If Dante, as is maintained by some writers, was engaged in tuition
while in Ravenna, it is to be feared that his pupils would find in him
an impatient master.

[127] Not that Dante ever mentions these any more than a hundred other
churches in which he must have spent thoughtful hours.

[128] _Purg._ xxviii. 20.

[129] A certain Cecco d'Ascoli stuck to him like a bur, charging him,
among other things, with lust, and a want of religious faith which would
one day secure him a place in his own Inferno. Cecco was himself burned
in Florence, in 1327, for making too much of evil spirits, and holding
that human actions are necessarily affected by the position of the
stars. He had been at one time a professor of astronomy.

GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142]


Vasari, in his _Lives of the Painters_, tells that in his day the
portrait of Dante by Giotto was still to be seen in the chapel of the
Podesta's palace in Florence. Writers of an earlier date had already
drawn attention to this work.[143] But in the course of an age when
Italians cared little for Dante, and less for Giotto, it was allowed to
be buried out of sight; and when at length there came a revival of
esteem for these great men, the alterations in the interior arrangement
of the palace were found to have been so sweeping that it was even
uncertain which out of many chambers had formerly served as the chapel.
Twenty years after a fruitless attempt had been made to discover whether
or not the portrait was still in existence, Signor Aubrey Bezzi,
encouraged by Mr. Wilde and Mr. Kirkup, took the first step in a search
(1839) which was to end by restoring to the world what is certainly the
most interesting of all portraits, if account be taken of its beauty,
as well as of who was its author and who its subject.

On the removal from it of a layer of lime, one of the end walls of what
had been the chapel was found to be covered by a fresco painting,
evidently the work of Giotto, and representing a Paradise--the subject
in which Dante's portrait was known to occur. As is usual in such works,
from the time of Giotto downwards, the subject is treated so as to allow
of the free introduction of contemporary personages. Among these was a
figure in a red gown, which there was no difficulty in recognising as
the portrait of Dante. It shows him younger and with a sweeter
expression than does Raphael's Dante, or Masaccio's,[144] or that in the
Cathedral of Florence,[145] or that of the mask said to have been taken
after his death. But to all of them it bears a strong resemblance.

The question of when this portrait was painted will easily be seen to be
one of much importance in connection with Dante's biography. The fresco
it belongs to is found to contain a cardinal, and a young man, who,
because he wears his hair long and has a coronet set on his cap, is
known to be meant for a French prince.[146] If, as is usually assumed,
this prince is Charles of Valois, then the date of the event celebrated
in the fresco is 1301 or 1302. With regard to when the work was
executed, Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle, in their valuable book, say as
follows:[147]--

    'All inferences to be deduced from the subject and form of these
    frescos point to the date of 1301-2. It may be inquired whether
    they were executed by Giotto at the time, and this inquiry can only
    be satisfied approximatively. It may be inferred that Dante's
    portrait would hardly have been introduced into a picture so
    conspicuously visible as this, had not the poet at the time been
    influent in Florence.... Dante's age in the fresco corresponds with
    the date of 1302, and is that of a man of thirty-five. He had
    himself enjoyed the highest office of Florence from June to August
    1300.[148] In the fresco he does not wear the dress of the
    "Priori," but he holds in the ranks of those near Charles of Valois
    an honourable place. It may be presumed that the frescos were
    executed previous[149] to Dante's exile, and this view is confirmed
    by the technical and artistic progress which they reveal. They
    exhibit, indeed, the master in a higher sphere of development than
    at Assisi and Rome.'

This account of the subject of the work and the probable date of its
execution may, I think, be accepted as containing all that is to be said
in favour of the current opinion on the matter. That writer after writer
has adopted that opinion without a sign of doubt as to its credibility
must surely have arisen from failure to observe the insuperable
difficulties it presents.

Both Charles of Valois and the Cardinal Acquasparta were in Florence
during part of the winter of 1301-1302; but the circumstances under
which they were there make it highly improbable that the Commonwealth
was anxious to do them honour beyond granting them the outward show of
respect which it would have been dangerous to refuse. Earlier in the
year 1301 the Cardinal Acquasparta, having failed in gaining the object
which brought him to Florence, had, as it were, shaken the dust of the
city from off his feet and left the people of it under interdict. While
Charles of Valois was in Florence the Cardinal returned to make a second
attempt to reconcile the opposing parties, failed a second time, and
again left the city under an interdict--if indeed the first had ever
been raised. On the occasion of his first visit, the Whites, who were
then in power, would have none of his counsels; on his second, the
Blacks in their turn despised them.[150] There would therefore have been
something almost satirical in the compliment, had the Commonwealth
resolved to give him a place in a triumphal picture.

As for Charles of Valois, though much was expected from an alliance with
him while he was still at a distance, the very party that invited his
presence was soon disgusted with him owing to his faithlessness and
greed. The earlier part of his stay was disturbed by pillage and
bloodshed. Nor is it easy to imagine how, at any time during his
residence of five months, the leading citizens could have either the
time or the wish to arrange for honouring him in a fashion he was not
the man to care for. His one craving was for money, and still more
money; and any leisure the members of public bodies had to spare from
giving heed to their own interests and securing vengeance upon their
opponents, was devoted to holding the common purse shut as tightly as
they could against their avaricious Pacificator. When he at last
delivered the city from his presence no one would have the heart to
revive the memory of his disastrous visit.

But if, in all this confusion of Florentine affairs, Giotto did receive
a commission to paint in the palace of the Podesta, yet it remains
incredible that he should have been suffered to assign to Dante, of all
men, a place of honour in the picture. No citizen had more stubbornly
opposed the policy which brought Charles of Valois to Florence, and that
Charles was in the city was reason enough for Dante to keep out of it.
In his absence, he was sentenced in January 1302 to pay a ruinously
heavy fine, and in the following March he was condemned to be put to
death if ever he was caught. On fuller acquaintance his fellow-citizens
liked the Frenchman as little as he, but this had no effect in softening
their dislike or removing their fear of Dante. We may be sure that any
friends he may still have had in Florence, as their influence could not
protect his goods from confiscation or him from banishment, would hardly
care to risk their own safety by urging, while his condemnation was
still fresh, the admission of his portrait among those of illustrious
Florentines.[151] It is true that there have been instances of great
artists having reached so high a pitch of fame as to be able to dictate
terms to patrons, however exalted. In his later years Giotto could
perhaps have made such a point a matter of treaty with his employers,
but in 1301 he was still young,[152] and great although his fame already
was, he could scarcely have ventured to insist on the Republic's
confessing its injustice to his friend; as it would have done had it
consented that Dante, newly driven into exile, should obtain a place of
honour in a work painted at the public cost.

These considerations seem to make it highly improbable that Giotto's
wall-painting was meant to do honour to Charles of Valois and the
Cardinal Acquasparta. But if it should still be held that it was painted
in 1302, we must either cease to believe, in spite of all that Vasari
and the others say, that the portrait is meant for Dante; or else
confess it to be inexplicable how it got there. A way out of the
difficulty begins to open up as soon as we allow ourselves some latitude
in speculating as to when Giotto may have painted the fresco. The order
in which that artist's works were produced is very imperfectly settled;
and it may easily be that the position in Vasari's pages of the mention
made by him of this fresco has given rise to a misunderstanding
regarding the date of it. He speaks of it at the very beginning of his
Life of Giotto. But this he does because he needs an illustration of
what he has been saying in his opening sentences about the advance that
painter made on Cimabue. Only after making mention of Dante's portrait
does he begin his chronological list of Giotto's works; to the portrait
he never returns, and so, as far as Vasari is concerned, it is without a
date. Judging of it by means of Mr. Kirkup's careful and beautiful
sketch--and unfortunately we have now no other means of knowing what the
original was like--it may safely be asserted to be in Giotto's ripest
style.[153] Everything considered, it is therefore allowable to search
the Florentine chronicles lower down for an event more likely to be the
subject of Giotto's fresco than that usually fixed upon.

We read in John Villani that in the middle of the year 1326 the Cardinal
Gianni Orsini came to Florence as Papal Legate and Pacificator of
Tuscany. The city was greatly pleased at his coming, and as an earnest
of gratitude for his services presented him with a cup containing a
thousand florins.[154] A month later there arrived Charles Duke of
Calabria, the eldest son of King Robert of Naples, and great-grandson of
Charles of Anjou. He came as Protector of the Commonwealth, which
office--an extraordinary one, and with a great salary attached to it--he
had been elected to hold for five years. Never before had a spectacle
like that of his entry been offered to Florence. Villani gives a long
list of the barons who rode in his train, and tells that in his
squadrons of men-at-arms there were no fewer than two hundred knights.
The chronicler pauses to bid the reader note how great an enterprise his
fellow-citizens had shown in bringing to sojourn among them, and in
their interest, not only such a powerful lord as the Duke of Calabria
was, but a Papal Legate as well. Italy counted it a great thing, he
says, and he deems that the whole world ought to know of it.[155]
Charles took up his abode in the Podesta's palace. He appears to have
gained a better place in the hearts of the Florentines than what they
were used to give to strangers and princes. When a son was born to him,
all the city rejoiced, and it mourned with him when, in a few weeks, he
lost the child. After seventeen months' experience of his rule the
citizens were sorry to lose him, and bade him a farewell as hearty as
their welcome had been. To some of them, it is true, the policy seemed a
dangerous one which bore even the appearance of subjecting the Republic
to the Royal House of Naples; and some of them could have wished that he
'had shown more vigour in civil and military affairs. But he was a
gentle lord, popular with the townsfolk, and in the course of his
residence he greatly improved the condition of things in Florence, and
brought to a close many feuds.'[156] They felt that the nine hundred
thousand gold florins spent on him and his men had, on the whole, been
well laid out.

One detail of the Duke's personal appearance deserves remark. We have
seen that the prince in the fresco has long hair. John Villani had known
the Duke well by sight, and when he comes to record his death and
describe what kind of man he was to look upon, he specially says that
'he wore his hair loose.'[157]

A subject worthy of Giotto's pencil, and one likely to be offered to him
if he was then in Florence, we have therefore found in this visit of the
Duke and the Cardinal. But that Giotto was in Florence at that time is
certain. He painted a portrait[158] of the Duke in the Palace of the
Signory; and through that prince, as Vasari tells, he was invited by
King Robert to go down to work in Naples. All this, in the absence of
evidence of any value in favour of another date, makes it, at the very
least, highly probable that the fresco was a work of 1326 or 1327.

In 1326 Dante had been dead for five years. The grudge his
fellow-townsmen had nourished against him for so long was now worn out.
We know that very soon after his death Florence began to be proud of
him; and even such of his old enemies as still survived would be willing
that Giotto should set him in a place of honour among the great
Florentines who help to fill the fresco of the Paradise. That he was
already dead would be no hindrance to his finding room alongside of
Charles of Calabria; for the age was wisely tolerant of such
anachronisms.[159] Had Dante been still living the painter would have
been less at liberty to create, out of the records he doubtless
possessed of the features of the friend who had paid him beforehand with
one immortal line, the face which, as we look into it, we feel to be a
glorified transcript of what it was in the flesh. It is the face of one
who has wellnigh forgotten his earthly life, instead of having the worst
of it still before him; of one who, from that troubled Italy which like
his own Sapia he knew but as a pilgrim, has passed to the 'true city,'
of which he remains for evermore a citizen--the city faintly imaged by
Giotto upon the chapel wall.

THE INFERNO.




CANTO I.


  In middle[160] of the journey of our days
    I found that I was in a darksome wood[161]--
    The right road lost and vanished in the maze.
  Ah me! how hard to make it understood
    How rough that wood was, wild, and terrible:
    By the mere thought my terror is renewed.
  More bitter scarce were death. But ere I tell
    At large of good which there by me was found,
    I will relate what other things befell.
  Scarce know I how I entered on that ground,                       10
    So deeply, at the moment when I passed
    From the right way, was I in slumber drowned.
  But when beneath a hill[162] arrived at last,
    Which for the boundary of the valley stood,
    That with such terror had my heart harassed,
  I upwards looked and saw its shoulders glowed,
    Radiant already with that planet's[163] light
    Which guideth surely upon every road.
  A little then was quieted by the sight
    The fear which deep within my heart had lain                    20
    Through all my sore experience of the night.
  And as the man, who, breathing short in pain,
    Hath 'scaped the sea and struggled to the shore,
    Turns back to gaze upon the perilous main;
  Even so my soul which fear still forward bore
    Turned to review the pass whence I egressed,
    And which none, living, ever left before.
  My wearied frame refreshed with scanty rest,
    I to ascend the lonely hill essayed;
    The lower foot[164] still that on which I pressed.              30
  And lo! ere I had well beginning made,
    A nimble leopard,[165] light upon her feet,
    And in a skin all spotted o'er arrayed:
  Nor ceased she e'er me full in the face to meet,
    And to me in my path such hindrance threw
    That many a time I wheeled me to retreat.
  It was the hour of dawn; with retinue
    Of stars[166] that were with him when Love Divine
    In the beginning into motion drew
  Those beauteous things, the sun began to shine;                   40
    And I took heart to be of better cheer
    Touching the creature with the gaudy skin,
  Seeing 'twas morn,[167] and spring-tide of the year;
    Yet not so much but that when into sight
    A lion[168] came, I was disturbed with fear.
  Towards me he seemed advancing in his might,
    Rabid with hunger and with head high thrown:
    The very air was tremulous with fright.
  A she-wolf,[169] too, beheld I further on;
    All kinds of lust seemed in her leanness pent:                  50
    Through her, ere now, much folk have misery known.
  By her oppressed, and altogether spent
    By the terror breathing from her aspect fell,
    I lost all hope of making the ascent.
  And as the man who joys while thriving well,
    When comes the time to lose what he has won
    In all his thoughts weeps inconsolable,
  So mourned I through the brute which rest knows none:
    She barred my way again and yet again,
    And thrust me back where silent is the sun.                     60
  And as I downward rushed to reach the plain,
    Before mine eyes appeared there one aghast,
    And dumb like those that silence long maintain.
  When I beheld him in the desert vast,
    'Whate'er thou art, or ghost or man,' I cried,
    'I pray thee show such pity as thou hast.'
  'No man,[170] though once I was; on either side
    Lombard my parents were, and both of them
    For native place had Mantua,' he replied.
  'Though late, _sub Julio_,[171] to the world I came,              70
    And lived at Rome in good Augustus' day,
    While yet false gods and lying were supreme.
  Poet I was, renowning in my lay
    Anchises' righteous son, who fled from Troy
    What time proud Ilion was to flames a prey.
  But thou, why going back to such annoy?
    The hill delectable why fear to mount,
    The origin and ground of every joy?'
  'And thou in sooth art Virgil, and the fount
    Whence in a stream so full doth language flow?'                 80
    Abashed, I answered him with humble front.
  'Of other poets light and honour thou!
    Let the long study and great zeal I've shown
    In searching well thy book, avail me now!
  My master thou, and author[172] thou, alone!
    From thee alone I, borrowing, could attain
    The style[173] consummate which has made me known.
  Behold the beast which makes me turn again:
    Deliver me from her, illustrious Sage;
    Because of her I tremble, pulse and vein.'                      90
  'Thou must attempt another pilgrimage,'
    Observing that I wept, he made reply,
    'If from this waste thyself thou 'dst disengage.
  Because the beast thou art afflicted by
    Will suffer none along her way to pass,
    But, hindering them, harasses till they die.
  So vile a nature and corrupt she has,
    Her raging lust is still insatiate,
    And food but makes it fiercer than it was.
  Many a creature[174] hath she ta'en for mate,                    100
    And more she'll wed until the hound comes forth
    To slay her and afflict with torment great.
  He will not batten upon pelf or earth;
    But he shall feed on valour, love, and lore;
    Feltro and Feltro[175] 'tween shall be his birth.
  He will save humbled Italy, and restore,
    For which of old virgin Camilla[176] died;
    Turnus, Euryalus, Nisus, died of yore.
  Her through all cities chasing far and wide,
    He at the last to Hell will thrust her down,                   110
    Whence envy[177] first unloosed her. I decide
  Therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on
    With me for guide;[178] and hence I'll lead thee where
    A place eternal shall to thee be shown.
  There shalt thou hear the howlings of despair
    In which the ancient spirits make lament,
    All of them fain the second death to share.
  Next shalt thou them behold who are content,
    Because they hope some time, though now in fire,
    To join the blessed they will win consent.                     120
  And if to these thou later wouldst aspire,
    A soul[179] shall guide thee, worthier far than I;
    When I depart thee will I leave with her.
  Because the Emperor[180] who reigns on high
    Wills not, since 'gainst His laws I did rebel,[181]
    That to His city I bring any nigh.
  O'er all the world He rules, there reigns as well;
    There is His city and exalted seat:
    O happy whom He chooses there to dwell!'
  And I to him: 'Poet, I thee entreat,                             130
    Even by that God who was to thee unknown,
    That I may 'scape this present ill, nor meet
  With worse, conduct me whither thou hast shown,
    That I may see Saint Peter's gate,[182] and those
    Whom thou reportest in such misery thrown.'
  He moved away; behind him held I close.


FOOTNOTES:

[160] _Middle_: In his _Convito_ (iv. 23), comparing human life to an
arch, Dante says that at the age of thirty-five a man has reached the
top and begins to go down. As he was born in 1265 that was his own age
in 1300, the year in which the action of the poem is laid.

[161] _Darksome wood_: A state of spiritual darkness or despair into
which he has gradually drifted, not without fault of his own.

[162] _A hill_: Lower down this hill is termed 'the origin and cause of
all joy.' It is symbolical of spiritual freedom--of the peace and
security that spring from the practice of virtue. Only, as it seems, by
gaining such a vantage-ground can he escape from the wilderness of
doubt--the valley of the shadow of death--in which he is lost.

[163] _That planet_: On the Ptolemaic system, which, as perfected by the
Arabian astronomers, and with some Christian additions, was that
followed by Dante, the sun is reckoned as one of the seven planets; all
the others as well as the earth and the fixed stars deriving their light
from it. Here the sunlight may signify the Divine help granted to all
men in their efforts after virtue.

[164] _The lower foot, etc._: This describes a cautious, slow ascent.

[165] _A nimble leopard_: The leopard and the lion and wolf that come
with it are suggested by Jeremiah v. 6: 'A lion out of the forest shall
slay them,' etc. We have Dante's own authority for it, in his letter to
Can Grande, that several meanings are often hidden under the incidents
of the _Comedy_. But whatever else the beasts may signify, their chief
meaning is that of moral hindrances. It is plain that the lion and wolf
are the sins of others--pride and avarice. If the leopard agrees with
them in this, it most probably stands for the envy of those among whom
Dante lived: at _Inf._ vi. 74 we find envy, pride, and avarice classed
together as the sins that have corrupted Florence. But from _Inf._ xvi.
106 it appears that Dante hoped to get the better of the leopard by
means of a cord which he wore girt about his loins. The cord is
emblematical of self-control; and hence the leopard seems best to answer
the idea of sensual pleasure in the sense of a temptation that makes
difficult the pursuit of virtue. But it will be observed that this
hindrance Dante trusts to overcome.

[166] _Stars, etc._: The sun being then in Aries, as it was believed to
have been at the creation.

[167] _Morn, etc._: It is the morning of Friday the 25th of March in the
year 1300, and by the use of Florence, which began the year on the
anniversary of the incarnation, it is the first day of the New Year. The
Good Friday of 1300 fell a fortnight later; but the 25th of March was
held to be the true anniversary of the crucifixion as well as of the
incarnation and of the creation of the world. The date of the action is
fixed by _Inf._ xxi. 112. The day was of good omen for success in the
struggle with his lower self.

[168] _A lion_: Pride or arrogance; to be taken in its widest sense of
violent opposition to all that is good.

[169] _A she-wolf_: Used elsewhere in the _Comedy_ to represent avarice.
Dante may have had specially in his mind the greed and worldly ambition
of the Pope and the Court of Rome, but it is plain from line 110 that
the wolf stands primarily for a sin, and not for a person or corporate
body.

[170] _No man_: Brunetto Latini, the friend and master of Dante, says
'the soul is the life of man, but without the body is not man.'

[171] _Sub Julio_: Julius was not even consul when Virgil was born. But
Dante reckoned Julius as the founder of the Empire, and therefore makes
the time in which he flourished his. Virgil was only twenty-five years
of age when Cæsar was slain; and thus it was under Augustus that his
maturer life was spent.

[172] _Author_: Dante defines an author as 'one worthy to be believed
and obeyed' (_Convito_ iv. 6). For a guide and companion on his great
pilgrimage he chooses Virgil, not only because of his fame as a poet,
but also because he had himself described a descent to the Shades--had
been already there. The vulgar conception of Virgil was that of a
virtuous great magician.

[173] _The style, etc._: Some at least of Dante's minor works had been
given to the world before 1300, certainly the _Vita Nuova_ and others of
his poems. To his study of Virgil he may have felt himself indebted for
the purity of taste that kept him superior to the frigid and artificial
style of his contemporaries, He prided himself on suiting his language
to his theme, as well as on writing straight from the heart.

[174] _Many a creature, etc._: Great men and states, infected with
avarice in its extended sense of encroachment on the rights of others.

[175] _Feltro and Feltro, etc._: Who the deliverer was that Dante
prophesies the coming of is not known, and perhaps never can be. Against
the claims of Can Grande of Verona the objection is that, at any date
which can reasonably be assigned for the publication of the _Inferno_,
he had done nothing to justify such bright hopes of his future career.
There seems proof, too, that till the _Paradiso_ was written Dante
entertained no great respect for the Scala family (_Purg._ xvi. 118,
xviii. 121). Neither is Verona, or the widest territory over which Can
Grande ever ruled, at all described by saying it lay between Feltro and
Feltro.--I have preferred to translate _nazi-one_ as birth rather than
as nation or people. 'The birth of the deliverer will be found to have
been between feltro and feltro.' Feltro, as Dante wrote it, would have
no capital letter; and according to an old gloss the deliverer is to be
of humble birth; _feltro_ being the name of a poor sort of cloth. This
interpretation I give as a curiosity more than anything else; for the
most competent critics have decided against it, or ignored it.--Henry of
Luxemburg, chosen Emperor in November 1308, is an old claimant for the
post of the allegorical _veltro_ or greyhound. On him Dante's hopes were
long set as the man who should 'save Italy;' and it seems not out of
place to draw attention to what is said of him by John Villani, the
contemporary and fellow-townsman of Dante: 'He was of a magnanimous
nature, though, as regarded his family, of poor extraction' (_Cronica_,
ix. 1). Whatever may be made of the Feltros, the description in the text
of the deliverer as one superior to all personal ambition certainly
answers better to Dante's ideal of a righteous Emperor than to the
character of a partisan leader like Uguccione della Faggiuola, or an
ambitious prince like Can Grande.

[176] _Camilla, etc._: All persons of the _Æneid_.

[177] _Envy_: That of Satan.

[178] _Thou hadst best, etc._: As will be seen from the next Canto,
Virgil has been sent to the relief of Dante; but how that is to be
wrought out is left to his own judgment. He might secure a partial
deliverance for his ward by conducting him up the Delectable Mount--the
peaceful heights familiar to himself, and which are to be won by the
practice of natural piety. He chooses the other course, of guiding Dante
through the regions of the future state, where the pilgrim's trust in
the Divine government will be strengthened by what he sees, and his soul
acquire a larger peace.

[179] _A soul_: Beatrice.

[180] _The Emperor_: The attribution of this title to God is significant
of Dante's lofty conception of the Empire.

[181] _'Gainst his laws, etc._: Virgil was a rebel only in the sense of
being ignorant of the Christian revelation (_Inf._ iv. 37).

[182] _Saint Peter's gate_: Virgil has not mentioned Saint Peter. Dante
names him as if to proclaim that it is as a Christian, though under
heathen guidance, that he makes the pilgrimage. Here the gate seems to
be spoken of as if it formed the entrance to Paradise, as it was
popularly believed to do, and as if it were at that point Virgil would
cease to guide him. But they are to find it nearer at hand, and after it
has been passed Virgil is to act as guide through Purgatory.




CANTO II.


  It was the close of day;[183] the twilight brown
    All living things on earth was setting free
    From toil, while I preparing was alone[184]
  To face the battle which awaited me,
    As well of ruth as of the perilous quest,
    Now to be limned by faultless memory.
  Help, lofty genius! Muses,[185] manifest
    Goodwill to me! Recording what befell,
    Do thou, O mind, now show thee at thy best!
  I thus began: 'Poet, and Guide as well,                           10
    Ere trusting me on this adventure wide,
    Judge if my strength of it be capable.
  Thou say'st that Silvius' father,[186] ere he died,
    Still mortal to the world immortal went,
    There in the body some time to abide.
  Yet that the Foe of evil was content
    That he should come, seeing what high effect,
    And who and what should from him claim descent,
  No room for doubt can thoughtful man detect:
    For he of noble Rome, and of her sway                           20
    Imperial, in high Heaven grew sire elect.
  And both of these,[187] the very truth to say,
    Were founded for the holy seat, whereon
    The Greater Peter's follower sits to-day.
  Upon this journey, praised by thee, were known
    And heard things by him, to the which he owed
    His triumph, whence derives the Papal gown.[188]
  That path the Chosen Vessel[189] later trod
    So of the faith assurance to receive,
    Which is beginning of salvation's road.                         30
  But why should I go? Who will sanction give?
    For I am no Æneas and no Paul;
    Me worthy of it no one can believe,
  Nor I myself. Hence venturing at thy call,
    I dread the journey may prove rash. But vain
    For me to reason; wise, thou know'st it all.'
  Like one no more for what he wished for fain,
    Whose purpose shares mutation with his thought
    Till from the thing begun he turns again;
  On that dim slope so grew I all distraught,                       40
    Because, by brooding on it, the design
    I shrank from, which before I warmly sought.
  'If well I understand these words of thine,'
    The shade of him magnanimous made reply,
    'Thy soul 'neath cowardice hath sunk supine,
  Which a man often is so burdened by,
    It makes him falter from a noble aim,
    As beasts at objects ill-distinguished shy.
  To loose thee from this terror, why I came,
    And what the speech I heard, I will relate,                     50
    When first of all I pitied thee. A dame[190]
  Hailed me where I 'mongst those in dubious state[191]
    Had my abode: so blest was she and fair,
    Her to command me I petitioned straight.
  Her eyes were shining brighter than the star;[192]
    And she began to say in accents sweet
    And tuneable as angel's voices are:
  "O Mantuan Shade, in courtesy complete,
    Whose fame survives on earth, nor less shall grow
    Through all the ages, while the world hath seat;                60
  A friend of mine, with fortune for his foe,
    Has met with hindrance on his desert way,
    And, terror-smitten, can no further go,
  But turns; and that he is too far astray,
    And that I rose too late for help, I dread,
    From what in Heaven concerning him they say.
  Go, with thy speech persuasive him bestead,
    And with all needful help his guardian prove,
    That touching him I may be comforted.
  Know, it is Beatrice seeks thee thus to move.                     70
    Thence come I where I to return am fain:
    My coming and my plea are ruled by love.
  When I shall stand before my Lord again,
    Often to Him I will renew thy praise."
    And here she ceased, nor did I dumb remain:
  "O virtuous Lady, thou alone the race
    Of man exaltest 'bove all else that dwell
    Beneath the heaven which wheels in narrowest space.[193]
  To do thy bidding pleases me so well,
    Though 'twere already done 'twere all too slow;                 80
    Thy wish at greater length no need to tell.
  But say, what tempted thee to come thus low,
    Even to this centre, from the region vast,[194]
    Whither again thou art on fire to go?"
  "This much to learn since a desire thou hast,"
    She answered, "briefly thee I'll satisfy,
    How, coming here, I through no terrors passed.
  We are, of right, such things alarmèd by,
    As have the power to hurt us; all beside
    Are harmless, and not fearful. Wherefore I--                    90
  Thus formed by God, His bounty is so wide--
    Am left untouched by all your miseries,
    And through this burning[195] unmolested glide.
  A noble lady[196] is in Heaven, who sighs
    O'er the obstruction where I'd have thee go,
    And breaks the rigid edict of the skies.
  Calling on Lucia,[197] thus she made her know
    What she desired: 'Thy vassal[198] now hath need
    Of help from thee; do thou then helpful show.'
  Lucia, who hates all cruelty, in speed                           100
    Rose, and approaching where I sat at rest,
    To venerable Rachel[199] giving heed,
  Me: 'Beatrice, true praise of God,' addressed;
    'Why not help him who had such love for thee,
    And from the vulgar throng to win thee pressed?
  Dost thou not hear him weeping pitiably,
    Nor mark the death now threatening him upon
    A flood[200] than which less awful is the sea?'
  Never on earth did any ever run,
    Allured by profit or impelled by fear,                         110
    Swifter than I, when speaking she had done,
  From sitting 'mong the blest descended here,
    My trust upon thy comely rhetoric cast,
    Which honours thee and those who lend it ear."
  When of these words she spoken had the last,
    She turned aside bright eyes which tears[201] did fill,
    And I by this was urged to greater haste.
  And so it was I joined thee by her will,
    And from that raging beast delivered thee,
    Which barred the near way up the beauteous hill.               120
  What ails thee then? Why thus a laggard be?
    Why cherish in thy heart a craven fear?
    Where is thy franchise, where thy bravery,
  When three such blessed ladies have a care
    For thee in Heaven's court, and these words of mine
    Thee for such wealth of blessedness prepare?'
  As flowers, by chills nocturnal made to pine
    And shut themselves, when touched by morning bright
    Upon their stems arise, full-blown and fine;
  So of my faltering courage changed the plight,                   130
    And such good cheer ran through my heart, it spurred
    Me to declare, like free-born generous wight:
  'O pitiful, who for my succour stirred!
    And thou how full of courtesy to run,
    Alert in service, hearkening her true word!
  Thou with thine eloquence my heart hast won
    To keen desire to go, and the intent
    Which first I held I now no longer shun.
  Therefore proceed; my will with thine is blent:
    Thou art my Guide, Lord, Master;[202] thou alone!'             140
    Thus I; and with him, as he forward went,
  The steep and rugged road I entered on.


FOOTNOTES:

[183] _Close of day_: The evening of the Friday. It comes on us with
something of a surprise that a whole day has been spent in the attempt
to ascend the hill, and in conference with Virgil.

[184] _Alone_: Of earthly creatures, though in company with Virgil, a
shade. In these words is to be found the keynote to the Canto. With the
sense of deliverance from immediate danger his enthusiasm has died away.
After all, Virgil is only a shade; and his heart misgives him at the
thought of engaging, in the absence of all human companionship, upon a
journey so full of terrors. He is not reassured till Virgil has
displayed his commission.

[185] _Muses_: The invocation comes now, the First Canto being properly
an introduction. Here it may be pointed out, as illustrating the
refinement of Dante's art, that the invocation in the _Purgatorio_ is in
a higher strain, and that in the _Paradiso_ in a nobler still.

[186] _Silvius' father_: Æneas, whose visit to the world of shades is
described in the Sixth _Æneid_. He finds there his father Anchises, who
foretells to him the fortunes of his descendants down to the time of
Augustus.

[187] _Both of these_: Dante uses language slightly apologetic as he
unfolds to Virgil, the great Imperialist poet, the final cause of Rome
and the Empire. But while he thus exalts the Papal office, making all
Roman history a preparation for its establishment, Dante throughout his
works is careful to refuse any but a spiritual or religious allegiance
to the Pope, and leaves himself free, as will be frequently seen in the
course of the _Comedy_, to blame the Popes as men, while yielding all
honour to their great office. In this emphatic mention of Rome as the
divinely-appointed seat of Peter's Chair may be implied a censure on the
Pope for the transference of the Holy See to Avignon, which was effected
in 1305, between the date assigned to the action of the poem and the
period when it was written.

[188] _Papal gown_: 'The great mantle' Dante elsewhere terms it; the
emblem of the Papal dignity. It was only in Dante's own time that
coronation began to take the place of investiture with the mantle.

[189] _Chosen Vessel_: Paul, who like Æneas visited the other world,
though not the same region of it. Throughout the poem instances drawn
from profane history, and even poetry and mythology, are given as of
authority equal to those from Christian sources.

[190] _A dame_: Beatrice, the heroine of the _Vita Nuova_, at the close
of which Dante promises some day to say of her what was never yet said
of any woman. She died in 1290, aged twenty-four. In the _Comedy_ she
fills different parts: she is the glorified Beatrice Portinari whom
Dante first knew as a fair Florentine girl; but she also represents
heavenly truth, or the knowledge of it--the handmaid of eternal life.
Theology is too hard and technical a term to bestow on her. Virgil, for
his part, represents the knowledge that men may acquire of Divine law by
the use of their reason, helped by such illumination as was enjoyed by
the virtuous heathen. In other words, he is the exponent of the Divine
revelation involved in the Imperial system--for the Empire was never far
from Dante's thoughts. To him it meant the perfection of just rule, in
which due cognisance is taken of every right and of every duty. The
relation Dante bears to these two is that of erring humanity struggling
to the light. Virgil leads him as far as he can, and then commits him to
the holier rule of Beatrice. But the poem would lose its charm if the
allegorical meaning of every passage were too closely insisted on. And,
worse than that, it cannot always be found.

[191] _Dubious state_: The limbo of the virtuous heathen (Canto iv.).

[192] _The star_: In the _Vita Nuova_ Dante speaks of the star in the
singular when he means the stars.

[193] _In narrowest space_: The heaven of the moon, on the Ptolemaic
system the lowest of the seven planets. Below it there is only the
heaven of fire, to which all the flames of earth are attracted. The
meaning is, above all on earth.

[194] _The region vast_: The empyrean, or tenth and highest heaven of
all. It is an addition by the Christian astronomers to the heavens of
the Ptolemaic system, and extends above the _primum mobile_, which
imparts to all beneath it a common motion, while leaving its own special
motion to each. The empyrean is the heaven of Divine rest.

[195] _Burning_: 'Flame of this burning,' allegorical, as applied to the
limbo where Virgil had his abode. He and his companions suffer only from
unfulfilled but lofty desire (_Inf._ iv. 41).

[196] _A noble lady_: The Virgin Mary, of whom it is said (_Parad._
xxxiii. 16) that her 'benignity not only succours those who ask, but
often anticipates their demand;' as here. She is the symbol of Divine
grace in its widest sense. Neither Christ nor Mary is mentioned by name
in the _Inferno_.

[197] _Lucia_: The martyr saint of Syracuse. Witte (_Dante-Forschungen_,
vol. ii. 30) suggests that Lucia Ubaldini may be meant, a
thirteenth-century Florentine saint, and sister of the Cardinal (_Inf._
x. 120). The day devoted to her memory was the 30th of May. Dante was
born in May, and if it could be proved that he was born on the 30th of
the month the suggestion would be plausible. But for the greater Lucy is
to be said that she was especially helpful to those troubled in their
eyesight, as Dante was at one time of his life. Here she is the symbol
of illuminating grace.

[198] _Thy vassal_: Saint Lucy being held in special veneration by
Dante; or only that he was one that sought light. The word _fedele_ may
of course, as it usually is, be read in its primary sense of 'faithful
one;' but it is old Italian for vassal; and to take the reference to be
to the duty of the overlord to help his dependant in need seems to give
force to the appeal.

[199] _Rachel_: Symbol of the contemplative life.

[200] _A flood, etc._: 'The sea of troubles' in which Dante is involved.

[201] _Tears_: Beatrice weeps for human misery--especially that of
Dante--though unaffected by the view of the sufferings of Inferno.

[202] _My Guide, etc._: After hearing how Virgil was moved to come,
Dante accepts him not only for his guide, as he did at the close of the
First Canto, but for his lord and master as well.




CANTO III.


  Through me to the city dolorous lies the way,
    Who pass through me shall pains eternal prove,
    Through me are reached the people lost for aye.
  'Twas Justice did my Glorious Maker move;
    I was created by the Power Divine,[203]
    The Highest Wisdom, and the Primal Love.
  No thing's creation earlier was than mine,
    If not eternal;[204] I for aye endure:
    Ye who make entrance, every hope resign!
  These words beheld I writ in hue obscure                          10
    On summit of a gateway; wherefore I:
    'Hard[205] is their meaning, Master.' Like one sure
  Beforehand of my thought, he made reply:
    'Here it behoves to leave all fears behind;
    All cowardice behoveth here to die.
  For now the place I told thee of we find,
    Where thou the miserable folk shouldst see
    Who the true good[206] of reason have resigned.'
  Then, with a glance of glad serenity,
    He took my hand in his, which made me bold,                     20
    And brought me in where secret things there be.
  There sighs and plaints and wailings uncontrolled
    The dim and starless air resounded through;
    Nor at the first could I from tears withhold.
  The various languages and words of woe,
    The uncouth accents,[207] mixed with angry cries
    And smiting palms and voices loud and low,
  Composed a tumult which doth circling rise
    For ever in that air obscured for aye;
    As when the sand upon the whirlwind flies.                      30
  And, horror-stricken,[208] I began to say:
    'Master, what sound can this be that I hear,
    And who the folk thus whelmed in misery?'
  And he replied: 'In this condition drear
    Are held the souls of that inglorious crew
    Who lived unhonoured, but from guilt kept clear.
  Mingled they are with caitiff angels, who,
    Though from avowed rebellion they refrained,
    Disloyal to God, did selfish ends pursue.
  Heaven hurled them forth, lest they her beauty stained;
    Received they are not by the nether hell,                       41
    Else triumph[209] thence were by the guilty gained.'
  And I: 'What bear they, Master, to compel
    Their lamentations in such grievous tone?'
    He answered: 'In few words I will thee tell.
  No hope of death is to the wretches known;
    So dim the life and abject where they sigh
    They count all sufferings easier than their own.
  Of them the world endures no memory;
    Mercy and justice them alike disdain.                           50
    Speak we not of them: glance, and pass them by.'
  I saw a banner[210] when I looked again,
    Which, always whirling round, advanced in haste
    As if despising steadfast to remain.
  And after it so many people chased
    In long procession, I should not have said
    That death[211] had ever wrought such countless waste.
  Some first I recognised, and then the shade
    I saw and knew of him, the search to close,
    Whose dastard soul the great refusal[212] made.                 60
  Straightway I knew and was assured that those
    Were of the tribe of caitiffs,[213] even the race
    Despised of God and hated of His foes.
  The wretches, who when living showed no trace
    Of life, went naked, and were fiercely stung
    By wasps and hornets swarming in that place.
  Blood drawn by these out of their faces sprung
    And, mingled with their tears, was at their feet
    Sucked up by loathsome worms it fell among.
  Casting mine eyes beyond, of these replete,                       70
    People I saw beside an ample stream,
    Whereon I said: 'O Master, I entreat,
  Tell who these are, and by what law they seem
    Impatient till across the river gone;
    As I distinguish by this feeble gleam.'
  And he: 'These things shall unto thee be known
    What time our footsteps shall at rest be found
    Upon the woful shores of Acheron.'
  Then with ashamèd eyes cast on the ground,
    Fearing my words were irksome in his ear,                       80
    Until we reached the stream I made no sound.
  And toward us, lo, within a bark drew near
    A veteran[214] who with ancient hair was white,
    Shouting: 'Ye souls depraved, be filled with fear.
  Hope never more of Heaven to win the sight;
    I come to take you to the other strand,
    To frost and fire and everlasting night.
  And thou, O living soul, who there dost stand,
    From 'mong the dead withdraw thee.' Then, aware
    That not at all I stirred at his command,                       90
  'By other ways,[215] from other ports thou'lt fare;
    But they will lead thee to another shore,
    And 'tis a skiff more buoyant must thee bear.'
  And then my leader: 'Charon, be not sore,
    For thus it has been willed where power ne'er came
    Short of the will; thou therefore ask no more.'
  And hereupon his shaggy cheeks grew tame
    Who is the pilot of the livid pool,
    And round about whose eyes glowed wheels of flame.
  But all the shades, naked and spent with dool,                   100
    Stood chattering with their teeth, and changing hue
    Soon as they heard the words unmerciful.
  God they blasphemed, and families whence they grew;
    Mankind, the time, place, seed in which began
    Their lives, and seed whence they were born. Then drew
  They crowding all together, as they ran,
    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore
    Predestinate for every godless man.
  The demon Charon, with eyes evermore
    Aglow, makes signals, gathering them all;                      110
    And whoso lingers smiteth with his oar.
  And as the faded leaves of autumn fall
    One after the other, till at last the bough
    Sees on the ground spread all its coronal;
  With Adam's evil seed so haps it now:
    At signs each falls in turn from off the coast,
    As fowls[216] into the ambush fluttering go.
  The gloomy waters thus by them are crossed,
    And ere upon the further side they land,
    On this, anew, is gathering a host.                            120
  'Son,' said the courteous Master,[217] 'understand,
    All such as in the wrath of God expire,
    From every country muster on this strand.
  To cross the river they are all on fire;
    Their wills by Heavenly justice goaded on
    Until their terror merges in desire.
  This way no righteous soul has ever gone;
    Wherefore[218] of thee if Charon should complain,
    Now art thou sure what by his words is shown.'
  When he had uttered this the dismal plain                        130
    Trembled[219] so violently, my terror past
    Recalling now, I'm bathed in sweat again.
  Out of the tearful ground there moaned a blast
    Whence lightning flashed forth red and terrible,
    Which vanquished all my senses; and, as cast
  In sudden slumber, to the ground I fell.


FOOTNOTES:

[203] _Power Divine, etc._: The Persons of the Trinity, described by
their attributes.

[204] _If not eternal_: Only the angels and the heavenly spheres were
created before Inferno. The creation of man came later. But from _Inf._
xxxiv. 124 it appears that Inferno was hollowed out of the earth; and at
_Parad._ vii. 124 the earth is declared to be 'corruptible and enduring
short while;' therefore not eternal.

[205] _Hard, etc._: The injunction to leave all hope behind makes Dante
hesitate to enter. Virgil anticipates the objection before it is fully
expressed, and reminds him that the passage through Inferno is to be
only one stage of his journey. Not by this gate will he seek to quit it.

[206] _True good, etc._: Truth in its highest form--the contemplation of
God.

[207] _Uncouth accents_: 'Like German,' says Boccaccio.

[208] _Horror-stricken_: 'My head enveloped in horror.' Some texts have
'error,' and this yields a better meaning--that Dante is amazed to have
come full into the crowd of suffering shades before he has even crossed
Acheron. If with the best texts 'horror' be read, the meaning seems to
be that he is so overwhelmed by fear as to lose his presence of mind.
They are not yet in the true Inferno, but only in the vestibule or
forecourt of it--the flat rim which runs round the edge of the pit.

[209] _Else triumph, etc._: The satisfaction of the rebel angels at
finding that they endured no worse punishment than that of such as
remained neutral.

[210] _A banner_: Emblem of the instability of those who would never
take a side.

[211] _That death, etc._: The touch is very characteristic of Dante. He
feigns astonishment at finding that such a proportion of mankind can
preserve so pitiful a middle course between good and evil, and spend
lives that are only 'a kind of--as it were.'

[212] _The great refusal_: Dante recognises him, and so he who made the
great refusal must have been a contemporary. Almost beyond doubt
Celestine V. is meant, who was in 1294 elected Pope against his will,
and resigned the tiara after wearing it a few months; the only Pope who
ever resigned it, unless we count Clement I. As he was not canonized
till 1326, Dante was free to form his own judgment of his conduct. It
has been objected that Dante would not treat with contumely a man so
devout as Celestine. But what specially fits him to be the
representative caitiff is just that, being himself virtuous, he
pusillanimously threw away the greatest opportunity of doing good. By
his resignation Boniface VIII. became Pope, to whose meddling in
Florentine affairs it was that Dante owed his banishment. Indirectly,
therefore, he owed it to the resignation of Celestine; so that here we
have the first of many private scores to be paid off in the course of
the _Comedy_. Celestine's resignation is referred to (_Inf._ xxvii.
104).--Esau and the rich young man in the Gospel have both been
suggested in place of Celestine. To either of them there lies the
objection that Dante could not have recognised him. And, besides,
Dante's contemporaries appear at once to have discovered Celestine in
him who made the great refusal. In Paradise the poet is told by his
ancestor Cacciaguida that his rebuke is to be like the wind, which
strikes most fiercely on the loftiest summits (_Parad._ xvii. 133); and
it agrees well with such a profession, that the first stroke he deals in
the _Comedy_ is at a Pope.

[213] _Caitiffs_: To one who had suffered like Dante for the frank part
he took in affairs, neutrality may well have seemed the unpardonable sin
in politics; and no doubt but that his thoughts were set on the trimmers
in Florence when he wrote, 'Let us not speak of them!'

[214] _A veteran_: Charon. In all this description of the passage of the
river by the shades, Dante borrows freely from Virgil. It has been
already remarked on _Inf._ ii. 28 that he draws illustrations from Pagan
sources. More than that, as we begin to find, he boldly introduces
legendary and mythological characters among the persons of his drama.
With Milton in mind, it surprises, on a first acquaintance with the
_Comedy_, to discover how nearly independent of angels is the economy
invented by Dante for the other world.

[215] _Other ways, etc._: The souls bound from earth to Purgatory gather
at the mouth of the Tiber, whence they are wafted on an angel's skiff to
their destination (_Purg._ ii. 100). It may be here noted that never
does Dante hint a fear of one day becoming a denizen of Inferno. It is
only the pains of Purgatory that oppress his soul by anticipation. So
here Charon is made to see at a glance that the pilgrim is not of those
'who make descent to Acheron.'

[216] _As fowls, etc._: 'As a bird to its lure'--generally interpreted
of the falcon when called back. But a witness of the sport of netting
thrushes in Tuscany describes them as 'flying into the vocal ambush in a
hurried, half-reluctant, and very remarkable manner.'

[217] _Courteous Master_: Virgil here gives the answer promised at line
76; and Dante by the epithet he uses removes any impression that his
guide had been wanting in courtesy when he bade him wait.

[218] _Wherefore_: Charon's displeasure only proves that he feels he has
no hold on Dante.

[219] _Trembled, etc._: Symbolical of the increase of woe in Inferno
when the doomed souls have landed on the thither side of Acheron. Hell
opens to receive them. Conversely, when any purified soul is released
from Purgatory the mountain of purification trembles to its base with
joy (_Purg._ xxi. 58).




CANTO IV.


  Resounding thunder broke the slumber deep
    That drowsed my senses, and myself I shook
    Like one by force awakened out of sleep.
  Then rising up I cast a steady look,
    With eyes refreshed, on all that lay around,
    And cognisance of where I found me took.
  In sooth, me on the valley's brink I found
    Of the dolorous abyss, where infinite
    Despairing cries converge with thundering sound.[220]
  Cloudy it was, and deep, and dark as night;                       10
    So dark that, peering eagerly to find
    What its depths held, no object met my sight.
  'Descend we now into this region blind,'
    Began the Poet with a face all pale;
    'I will go first, and do thou come behind.'
  Marking the wanness on his cheek prevail,
    I asked, 'How can I, seeing thou hast dread,
    My wonted comforter when doubts assail?'
  'The anguish of the people,' then he said,
    'Who are below, has painted on my face                          20
    Pity,[221] by thee for fear interpreted.
  Come! The long journey bids us move apace.'
    Then entered he and made me enter too
    The topmost circle girding the abyss.
  Therein, as far as I by listening knew,
    There was no lamentation save of sighs,
    Whence throbbed the air eternal through and through.
  This, sorrow without suffering made arise
    From infants and from women and from men,
    Gathered in great and many companies.                           30
  And the good Master: 'Wouldst thou[222] nothing then
    Of who those spirits are have me relate?
    Yet know, ere passing further, although when
  On earth they sinned not, worth however great
    Availed them not, they being unbaptized--
    Part[223] of the faith thou holdest. If their fate
  Was to be born ere man was Christianised,
    God, as behoved, they never could adore:
    And I myself am with this folk comprised.
  For such defects--our guilt is nothing more--                     40
    We are thus lost, suffering from this alone
    That, hopeless, we our want of bliss deplore.'
  Greatly I sorrowed when he made this known,
    Because I knew that some who did excel
    In worthiness were to that limbo[224] gone.
  'Tell me, O Sir,' I prayed him, 'Master,[225] tell,'
    --That I of the belief might surety win,
    Victorious every error to dispel--
  'Did ever any hence to bliss attain
    By merit of another or his own?'                                50
    And he, to whom my hidden drift[226] was plain:
  'I to this place but lately[227] had come down,
    When I beheld one hither make descent;
    A Potentate[228] who wore a victor's crown.
  The shade of our first sire forth with him went,
    And his son Abel's, Noah's forth he drew,
    Moses' who gave the laws, the obedient
  Patriarch Abram's, and King David's too;
    And, with his sire and children, Israel,
    And Rachel, winning whom such toils he knew;                    60
  And many more, in blessedness to dwell.
    And I would have thee know, earlier than these
    No human soul was ever saved from Hell.'
  While thus he spake our progress did not cease,
    But we continued through the wood to stray;
    The wood, I mean, with crowded ghosts for trees.
  Ere from the summit far upon our way
    We yet had gone, I saw a flame which glowed,
    Holding a hemisphere[229] of dark at bay.
  'Twas still a little further on our road,                         70
    Yet not so far but that in part I guessed
    That honourable people there abode.
  'Of art and science Ornament confessed!
    Who are these honoured in such high degree,
    And in their lot distinguished from the rest?'
  He said: 'For them their glorious memory,
    Still in thy world the subject of renown,
    Wins grace[230] by Heaven distinguished thus to be.'
  Meanwhile I heard a voice: 'Be honour shown
    To the illustrious poet,[231] for his shade                     80
    Is now returning which a while was gone.'
  When the voice paused nor further utterance made,
    Four mighty shades drew near with one accord,
    In aspect neither sorrowful nor glad.
  'Consider that one, armèd with a sword,'[232]
    Began my worthy Master in my ear,
    'Before the three advancing like their lord;
  For he is Homer, poet with no peer:
    Horace the satirist is next in line,
    Ovid comes third, and Lucan in the rear.                        90
  And 'tis because their claim agrees with mine
    Upon the name they with one voice did cry,
    They to their honour[233] in my praise combine.'
  Thus I beheld their goodly company--
    The lords[234] of song in that exalted style
    Which o'er all others, eagle-like, soars high.
  Having conferred among themselves a while
    They turned toward me and salutation made,
    And, this beholding, did my Master smile.[235]
  And honour higher still to me was paid,                          100
    For of their company they made me one;
    So I the sixth part 'mong such genius played.
  Thus journeyed we to where the brightness shone,
    Holding discourse which now 'tis well to hide,
    As, where I was, to hold it was well done.
  At length we reached a noble castle's[236] side
    Which lofty sevenfold walls encompassed round,
    And it was moated by a sparkling tide.
  This we traversed as if it were dry ground;
    I through seven gates did with those sages go;                 110
    Then in a verdant mead people we found
  Whose glances were deliberate and slow.
    Authority was stamped on every face;
    Seldom they spake, in tuneful voices low.
  We drew apart to a high open space
    Upon one side which, luminously serene,
    Did of them all a perfect view embrace.
  Thence, opposite, on the enamel green
    Were shown me mighty spirits; with delight
    I still am stirred them only to have seen.                     120
  With many more, Electra was in sight;
    'Mong them I Hector and Æneas spied,
    Cæsar in arms,[237] his eyes, like falcon's, bright.
  And, opposite, Camilla I descried;
    Penthesilea too; the Latian King
    Sat with his child Lavinia by his side.
  Brutus[238] I saw, who Tarquin forth did fling;
    Cornelia, Marcia,[239] Julia, and Lucrece.
    Saladin[240] sat alone. Considering
  What lay beyond with somewhat lifted eyes,                       130
    The Master[241] I beheld of those that know,
    'Mong such as in philosophy were wise.
  All gazed on him as if toward him to show
    Becoming honour; Plato in advance
    With Socrates: the others stood below.
  Democritus[242] who set the world on chance;
    Thales, Diogenes, Empedocles,
    Zeno, and Anaxagoras met my glance;
  Heraclitus, and Dioscorides,
    Wise judge of nature. Tully, Orpheus, were                     140
    With ethic Seneca and Linus.[243] These,
  And Ptolemy,[244] too, and Euclid, geometer,
    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicen,[245]
    Averroes,[246] the same who did prepare
  The Comment, saw I; nor can tell again
    The names of all I saw; the subject wide
    So urgent is, time often fails me. Then
  Into two bands the six of us divide;
    Me by another way my Leader wise
    Doth from the calm to air which trembles, guide.               150
  I reach a part[247] which all benighted lies.


FOOTNOTES:

[220] _Thundering sound_: In a state of unconsciousness, Dante, he knows
not how, has been conveyed across Acheron, and is awakened by what seems
like the thunder-peal following the lightning-flash which made him
insensible. He now stands on the brink of Inferno, where the sounds
peculiar to each region of it converge and are reverberated from its
rim. These sounds are not again to be heard by him except in their
proper localities. No sooner does he actually pass into the First Circle
than he hears only sighs.--As regards the topography of Inferno, it is
enough, as yet, to note that it consists of a cavity extending from the
surface to the centre of the earth; narrowing to its base, and with many
circular ledges or terraces, of great width in the case of the upper
ones, running round its wall--that is, round the sides of the pit. Each
terrace or circle is thus less in circumference than the one above it.
From one circle to the next there slopes a bank of more or less height
and steepness. Down the bank which falls to the comparatively flat
ground of the First Circle they are now about to pass.--To put it
otherwise, the Inferno is an inverted hollow cone.

[221] _Pity_: The pity felt by Virgil has reference only to those in the
circle they are about to enter, which is his own. See also _Purg._ iii.
43.

[222] _Wouldst thou, etc._: He will not have Dante form a false opinion
of the character of those condemned to the circle which is his own.

[223] _Part_: _parte_, altered by some editors into _porta_; but though
baptism is technically described as the gate of the sacraments, it never
is as the gate of the faith. A tenet of Dante's faith was that all the
unbaptized are lost. He had no choice in the matter.

[224] _Limbo_: Border, or borderland. Dante makes the First Circle
consist of the two limbos of Thomas Aquinas: that of unbaptized infants,
_limbus puerorum_, and that of the fathers of the old covenant, _limbus
sanctorum patrum_. But the second he finds is now inhabited only by the
virtuous heathen.

[225] _Sir_--_Master_: As a delicate means of expressing sympathy, Dante
redoubles his courtesy to Virgil.

[226] _Hidden drift_: to find out, at first hand as it were, if the
article in the creed is true which relates to the Descent into Hell;
and, perhaps, to learn if when Christ descended He delivered none of the
virtuous heathen.

[227] _Lately_: Virgil died about half a century before the crucifixion.

[228] _A Potentate_: The name of Christ is not mentioned in the
_Inferno_.

[229] _A hemisphere, etc._: An elaborate way of saying that part of the
limbo was clearly lit. The flame is symbolical of the light of genius,
or of virtue; both in Dante's eyes being modes of worth.

[230] _Wins grace, etc._: The thirst for fame was one keenly felt and
openly confessed by Dante. See, _e.g._ _De Monarchia_, i. 1. In this he
anticipated the humanists of the following century. Here we find that to
be famous on earth helps the case of disembodied souls.

[231] _Poet_: Throughout the _Comedy_, with the exception of _Parad._ i.
29, and xxv. 8, the term 'poet' is confined to those who wrote in Greek
and Latin. In _Purg._ xxi. 85 the name of poet is said to be that 'which
is most enduring and honourable.'

[232] _A sword_: Because Homer sings of battles. Dante's acquaintance
with his works can have been but slight, as they were not then
translated into Latin, and Dante knew little or no Greek.

[233] _To their honour_: 'And in that they do well:' perhaps as showing
themselves free from jealousy. But the remark of Benvenuto of Imola is:
'Poets love and honour one another, and are never envious and
quarrelsome like those who cultivate the other arts and sciences.'--I
quote with misgiving from Tamburini's untrustworthy Italian translation.
Benvenuto lectured on the _Comedy_ in Bologna for some years about 1370.
It is greatly to be wished that his commentary, lively and full of
side-lights as it is, should be printed in full from the original Latin.

[234] _The lords, etc._: Not the company of him--Homer or Virgil--who is
lord of the great song, and soars above all others; but the company of
the great masters, whose verse, etc.

[235] _Did my Master smile_: To see Dante made free of the guild of
great poets; or, it may be, to think they are about to discover in him a
fellow poet.

[236] _A noble castle_: Where the light burns, and in which, as their
peculiar seat, the shades of the heathen distinguished for virtue and
genius reside. The seven walls are in their number symbolical of the
perfect strength of the castle; or, to take it more pedantically, may
mean the four moral virtues and the three speculative. The gates will
then stand for the seven liberal arts of grammar, rhetoric, etc. The
moat may be eloquence, set outside the castle to signify that only as
reflected in the eloquent words of inspired men can the outside world
get to know wisdom. Over the stream Dante passes easily, as being an
adept in learned speech. The castle encloses a spacious mead enamelled
with eternal green.

[237] _Cæsar in arms, etc._: Suetonius says of Cæsar that he was of
fair complexion, but had black and piercing eyes. Brunetto Latini,
Dante's teacher, says in his _Tesoro_ (v. 11), of the hawk here
mentioned--the _grifagno_--that its eyes 'flame like fire.'

[238] _Brutus_: Introduced here that he may not be confounded with the
later Brutus, for whom is reserved the lowest place of all in Inferno.

[239] _Marcia_: Wife of Cato; mentioned also in _Purg._ i. _Julia_:
daughter of Cæsar and wife of Pompey.

[240] _Saladin_: Died 1193. To the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
he supplied the ideal of a just Mohammedan ruler. Here are no other
such. 'He sits apart, because not of gentle birth,' says Boccaccio;
which shows what even a man of genius risks when he becomes a
commentator.

[241] _The Master_: Aristotle, often spoken of by Dante as the
Philosopher, and reverenced by him as the genius to whom the secrets of
nature lay most open.

[242] _Democritus, etc._: According to whom the world owes its form to a
chance arrangement of atoms.

[243] _Linus_: Not Livy, into which some have changed it. Linus is
mentioned by Virgil along with Orpheus, _Egl._ iv.

[244] _Ptolemy_: Greek geographer of the beginning of the second
century, and author of the system of the world believed in by Dante, and
freely used by him throughout the poem.

[245] _Avicenna_: A physician, born in Bokhara, and died at Ispahan,
1037. His _Medical Canon_ was for centuries used as a text-book in
Europe.

[246] _Averroes_: A Mohammedan philosopher of Cordova, died 1198. In his
great Commentary on Aristotle he gives and explains every sentence of
that philosopher's works. He was himself ignorant of Greek, and made use
of Arabic versions. Out of his Arabic the Commentary was translated into
Hebrew, and thence into Latin. The presence of the three Mohammedans in
this honourable place greatly puzzles the early commentators.

[247] _A part, etc._: He passes into the darkness of the Limbo out of
the brightly-lit, fortified enclosure. It is worth remarking, as one
reads, how vividly he describes his first impression of a new scene,
while when he comes to leave it a word is all he speaks.




CANTO V.


  From the First Circle thus I downward went
    Into the Second,[248] which girds narrower space,
    But greater woe compelling loud lament.
  Minos[249] waits awful there and snarls, the case
    Examining of all who enter in;
    And, as he girds him, dooms them to their place.
  I say, each ill-starred spirit must begin
    On reaching him its guilt in full to tell;
    And he, omniscient as concerning sin,
  Sees to what circle it belongs in Hell;                           10
    Then round him is his tail as often curled
    As he would have it stages deep to dwell.
  And evermore before him stand a world
    Of shades; and all in turn to judgment come,
    Confess and hear, and then are downward hurled.[250]
  'O thou who comest to the very home
    Of woe,' when he beheld me Minos cried,
    Ceasing a while from utterance of doom,
  'Enter not rashly nor in all confide;
    By ease of entering be not led astray.'                         20
    'Why also[251] growling?' answered him my Guide;
  'Seek not his course predestinate to stay;
    For thus 'tis willed[252] where nothing ever fails
    Of what is willed. No further speech essay.'
  And now by me are agonising wails
    Distinguished plain; now am I come outright
    Where grievous lamentation me assails.
  Now had I reached a place devoid of light,
    Raging as in a tempest howls the sea
    When with it winds, blown thwart each other, fight.             30
  The infernal storm is raging ceaselessly,
    Sweeping the shades along with it, and them
    It smites and whirls, nor lets them ever be.
  Arrived at the precipitous extreme,[253]
    In shrieks and lamentations they complain,
    And even the Power Divine itself blaspheme.
  I understood[254] that to this mode of pain
    Are doomed the sinners of the carnal kind,
    Who o'er their reason let their impulse reign.
  As starlings in the winter-time combined                          40
    Float on the wing in crowded phalanx wide,
    So these bad spirits, driven by that wind,
  Float up and down and veer from side to side;
    Nor for their comfort any hope they spy
    Of rest, or even of suffering mollified.
  And as the cranes[255] in long-drawn company
    Pursue their flight while uttering their song,
    So I beheld approach with wailing cry
  Shades lifted onward by that whirlwind strong.
    'Master, what folk are these,'[256] I therefore said,           50
    'Who by the murky air are whipped along?'
  'She, first of them,' his answer thus was made,
    'Of whom thou wouldst a wider knowledge win,
    O'er many tongues and peoples, empire swayed.
  So ruined was she by licentious sin
    That she decreed lust should be uncontrolled,
    To ease the shame that she herself was in.
  She is Semiramis, of whom 'tis told
    She followed Ninus, and his wife had been.
    Hers were the realms now by the Sultan ruled.                   60
  The next[257] is she who, amorous and self-slain,
    Unto Sichæus' dust did faithless show:
    Then lustful Cleopatra.' Next was seen
  Helen, for whom so many years in woe
    Ran out; and I the great Achilles knew,
    Who at the last[258] encountered love for foe.
  Paris I saw and Tristram.[259] In review
    A thousand shades and more, he one by one
    Pointed and named, whom love from life withdrew.
  And after I had heard my Teacher run                              70
    O'er many a dame of yore and many a knight,
    I, lost in pity, was wellnigh undone.
  Then I: 'O Poet, if I only might
    Speak with the two that as companions hie,
    And on the wind appear to be so light!'[260]
  And he to me: 'When they shall come more nigh
    Them shalt thou mark, and by the love shalt pray
    Which leads them onward, and they will comply.'
  Soon as the wind bends them to where we stay
    I lift my voice: 'O wearied souls and worn!                     80
    Come speak with us if none[261] the boon gainsay.'
  Then even as doves,[262] urged by desire, return
    On outspread wings and firm to their sweet nest
    As through the air by mere volition borne,
  From Dido's[263] band those spirits issuing pressed
    Towards where we were, athwart the air malign;
    My passionate prayer such influence possessed.
  'O living creature,[264] gracious and benign,
    Us visiting in this obscurèd air,
    Who did the earth with blood incarnadine;                       90
  If in the favour of the King we were
    Who rules the world, we for thy peace[265] would pray,
    Since our misfortunes thy compassion stir.
  Whate'er now pleases thee to hear or say
    We listen to, or tell, at your demand;[266]
    While yet the wind, as now, doth silent stay.
  My native city[267] lies upon the strand
    Where to the sea descends the river Po
    For peace, with all his tributary band.
  Love, in a generous heart set soon aglow,                        100
    Seized him for the fair form was mine above;
    And still it irks me to have lost it so.[268]
  Love, which absolves[269] no one beloved from love,
    So strong a passion for him in me wrought
    That, as thou seest, I still its mastery prove.
  Love led us where we in one death were caught.
    For him who slew us waits Caïna[270] now.'
    Unto our ears these words from them were brought.
  When I had heard these troubled souls, my brow
    I downward bent, and long while musing stayed,                 110
    Until the Poet asked: 'What thinkest thou?'
  And when I answered him, 'Alas!' I said,
    'Sweet thoughts how many, and what strong desire,
    These to their sad catastrophe betrayed!'
  Then, turned once more to them, I to inquire
    Began: 'Francesca, these thine agonies
    Me with compassion unto tears inspire.
  But tell me, at the season of sweet sighs
    What sign made love, and what the means he chose
    To strip your dubious longings of disguise?'                   120
  And she to me: 'The bitterest of woes
    Is to remember in the midst of pain
    A happy past; as well thy teacher[271] knows.
  Yet none the less, and since thou art so fain
    The first occasion of our love to hear,
    Like one I speak that cannot tears restrain.
  As we for pastime one day reading were
    How Lancelot[272] by love was fettered fast--
    All by ourselves and without any fear--
  Moved by the tale our eyes we often cast                         130
    On one another, and our colour fled;
    But one word was it, vanquished us at last.
  When how the smile, long wearied for, we read
    Was kissed by him who loved like none before,
    This one, who henceforth never leaves me, laid
  A kiss on my mouth, trembling the while all o'er.
    The book was Galahad,[273] and he as well
    Who wrote the book. That day we read no more.'
  And while one shade continued thus to tell,
    The other wept so bitterly, I swooned                          140
    Away for pity, and as dead I fell:
  Yea, as a corpse falls, fell I on the ground.


FOOTNOTES:

[248] _The Second_: The Second Circle of the Inferno, and the first of
punishment. The lower the circle, the more rigorous the penalty endured
in it. Here is punished carnal sin.

[249] _Minos_: Son of Jupiter and King of Crete, so severely just as to
be made after death one of the judges of the under world. He is degraded
by Dante, as many other noble persons of the old mythology are by him,
into a demon. Unlike the fallen angels of Milton, Dante's devils have no
interest of their own. Their only function is to help in working out
human destinies.

[250] _Downward hurled_: Each falls to his proper place without
lingering by the way. All through Inferno there is an absence of direct
Divine interposition. It is ruled, as it were, by a course of nature.
The sinners, compelled by a fatal impulse, advance to hear their doom,
just as they fall inevitably one by one into Charon's boat. Minos by a
sort of devilish instinct sentences each sinner to his appropriate
punishment. In _Inf._ xxvii. 127 we find the words in which Minos utters
his judgment. In _Inf._ xxi. 29 a devil bears the sinner to his own
place.

[251] _Why also, etc._: Like Charon. If Minos represents conscience, as
some would have it, Dante is here again assailed by misgivings as to his
enterprise, and is quieted by reason in the person of Virgil.

[252] _Thus 'tis willed, etc._: These two lines are the same as those to
Charon, _Inf._ iii. 95, 96.

[253] _Precipitous extreme_: Opinions vary as to what is meant by
_ruina_. As Dante is certainly still on the outer edge of the Second
Circle or terrace, and while standing there hears distinctly the words
the spirits say when they reach the _ruina_, it most likely denotes the
steep slope falling from the First to the Second Circle. The spirits,
driven against the wall which hems them in, burst into sharp
lamentations against their irremediable fate.

[254] _I understood, etc._: From the nature of the punishment, which,
like all the others invented by Dante, bears some relation to the sin to
which it is assigned. They who on earth failed to exercise
self-restraint are beaten hither and thither by every wind that blows;
and, as once they were blinded by passion, so now they see nothing
plainly in that dim and obscure place. That Dante should assign the
least grievous punishment of all to this sin throws light upon his views
of life. In his eyes it had more than any other the excuse of natural
bent, and had least of malice. Here, it must be remarked, are no
seducers. For them a lower depth is reserved (_Inf._ xviii. See also
_Purg._ xxvii. 15).

[255] _The cranes_: 'The cranes are a kind of bird that go in a troop,
as cavaliers go to battle, following one another in single file. And one
of them goes always in front as their gonfalonier, guiding and leading
them with its voice' (Brunetto Latini, _Tesoro_, v. 27).

[256] _What folk are these_: The general crowd of sinners guilty of
unlawful love are described as being close packed like starlings. The
other troop, who go in single file like cranes, are those regarding whom
Dante specially inquires; and they prove to be the nobler sort of
sinners--lovers with something tragic or pathetic in their fate.

[257] _The next_: Dido, perhaps not named by Virgil because to him she
owed her fame. For love of Æneas she broke the vow of perpetual chastity
made on the tomb of her husband.

[258] _At the last, etc._: Achilles, when about to espouse Polyxena, and
when off his guard, was slain.

[259] _Paris ... and Tristram_: Paris of Troy, and the Tristram of King
Arthur's Table.

[260] _So light_: Denoting the violence of the passion to which they had
succumbed.

[261] _If none_: If no Superior Power.

[262] _Doves_: The motion of the tempest-driven shades is compared to
the flight of birds--starlings, cranes, and doves. This last simile
prepares us for the tenderness of Francesca's tale.

[263] _Dido_: Has been already indicated, and is now named. This
association of the two lovers with Virgil's Dido is a further delicate
touch to engage our sympathy; for her love, though illicit, was the
infirmity of a noble heart.

[264] _Living creature_: 'Animal.' No shade, but an animated body.

[265] _Thy peace_: Peace from all the doubts that assail him, and which
have compelled him to the journey: peace, it may be, from temptation to
sin cognate to her own. Even in the gloom of Inferno her great
goodheartedness is left her--a consolation, if not a grace.

[266] _Your demand_: By a refinement of courtesy, Francesca, though
addressing only Dante, includes Virgil in her profession of willingness
to tell all they care to hear. But as almost always, he remains silent.
It is not for his good the journey is being made.

[267] _Native city_: Ravenna. The speaker is Francesca, daughter of
Guido of Polenta, lord of Ravenna. About the year 1275 she was married
to Gianciotto (Deformed John) Malatesta, son of the lord of Rimini; the
marriage, like most of that time in the class to which she belonged,
being one of political convenience. She allowed her affections to settle
on Paolo, her husband's handsome brother; and Gianciotto's suspicions
having been aroused, he surprised the lovers and slew them on the spot.
This happened at Pesaro. The association of Francesca's name with Rimini
is merely accidental. The date of her death is not known. Dante can
never have set eyes on Francesca; but at the battle of Campaldino in
1289, where he was present, a troop of cavaliers from Pistoia fought on
the Florentine side under the command of her brother Bernardino; and in
the following year, Dante being then twenty-five years of age, her
father, Guido, was Podesta in Florence. The Guido of Polenta, lord of
Ravenna, whom Dante had for his last and most generous patron, was
grandson of that elder Guido, and nephew of Francesca.

[268] _To have lost it so_: A husband's right and duty were too well
defined in the prevalent social code for her to complain that Gianciotto
avenged himself. What she does resent is that she was left no
breathing-space for repentance and farewells.

[269] _Which absolves, etc._: Which compels whoever is beloved to love
in return. Here is the key to Dante's comparatively lenient estimate of
the guilt of Francesca's sin. See line 39, and _Inf._ xi. 83. The Church
allowed no distinctions with regard to the lost. Dante, for his own
purposes, invents a scale of guilt; and in settling the degrees of it he
is greatly influenced by human feeling--sometimes by private likes and
dislikes. The vestibule of the caitiffs, _e.g._, is his own creation.

[270] _Caïna_: The Division of the Ninth and lowest Circle, assigned to
those treacherous to their kindred (_Inf._ xxxii. 58). Her husband was
still living in 1300.--May not the words of this line be spoken by
Paolo? It is as a fratricide even more than as the slayer of his wife
that Gianciotto is to find his place in Caïna. The words are more in
keeping with the masculine than the feminine character. They certainly
jar somewhat with the gentler censure of line 102. And, immediately
after, Dante speaks of what the 'souls' have said.

[271] _Thy teacher_: Boethius, one of Dante's favourite authors
(_Convito_ ii. 13), says in his _De Consol. Phil._, 'The greatest misery
in adverse fortune is once to have been happy.' But, granting that Dante
found the idea in Boethius, it is clearly Virgil that Francesca means.
She sees that Dante's guide is a shade, and gathers from his grave
passionless aspect that he is one condemned for ever to look back with
futile regret upon his happier past.

[272] _Lancelot_: King Arthur's famous knight, who was too bashful to
make his love for Queen Guinivere known to her. Galahad, holding the
secret of both, persuaded the Queen to make the first declaration of
love at a meeting he arranged for between them. Her smile, or laugh, as
she 'took Lancelot by the chin and kissed him,' assured her lover of his
conquest. The Arthurian Romances were the favourite reading of the
Italian nobles of Dante's time.

[273] _Galahad_: From the part played by Galahad, or Galeotto, in the
tale of Lancelot, his name grew to be Italian for Pander. The book, says
Francesca, was that which tells of Galahad; and the author of it proved
a very Galahad to us. The early editions of the _Decameron_ bear the
second title of 'The Prince Galeotto.'




CANTO VI.


  When I regained my senses, which had fled
    At my compassion for the kindred two,
    Which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head,
  New torments and a crowd of sufferers new
    I see around me as I move again,[274]
    Where'er I turn, where'er I bend my view.
  In the Third Circle am I of the rain
    Which, heavy, cold, eternal, big with woe,
    Doth always of one kind and force remain.
  Large hail and turbid water, mixed with snow,                     10
    Keep pouring down athwart the murky air;
    And from the ground they fall on, stenches grow.
  The savage Cerberus,[275] a monster drear,
    Howls from his threefold throat with canine cries
    Above the people who are whelmèd there.
  Oily and black his beard, and red his eyes,
    His belly huge: claws from his fingers sprout.
    The shades he flays, hooks, rends in cruel wise.
  Beat by the rain these, dog-like, yelp and shout,
    And shield themselves in turn with either side;                 20
    And oft[276] the wretched sinners turn about.
  When we by Cerberus, great worm,[277] were spied,
    He oped his mouths and all his fangs he showed,
    While not a limb did motionless abide.
  My Leader having spread his hands abroad,
    Filled both his fists with earth ta'en from the ground,
    And down the ravening gullets flung the load.
  Then, as sharp set with hunger barks the hound,
    But is appeased when at his meat he gnaws,
    And, worrying it, forgets all else around;                      30
  So with those filthy faces there it was
    Of the fiend Cerberus, who deafs the crowd
    Of souls till they from hearing fain would pause.
  We, travelling o'er the spirits who lay cowed
    And sorely by the grievous showers harassed,
    Upon their semblances[278] of bodies trod.
  Prone on the ground the whole of them were cast,
    Save one of them who sat upright with speed
    When he beheld that near to him we passed.
  'O thou who art through this Inferno led,[279]                    40
    Me if thou canst,' he asked me, 'recognise;
    For ere I was dismantled thou wast made.'
  And I to him: 'Thy present tortured guise
    Perchance hath blurred my memory of thy face,
    Until it seems I ne'er on thee set eyes.
  But tell me who thou art, within this place
    So cruel set, exposed to such a pain,
    Than which, if greater, none has more disgrace.'
  And he: 'Thy city, swelling with the bane
    Of envy till the sack is running o'er,                          50
    Me in the life serene did once contain.
  As Ciacco[280] me your citizens named of yore;
    And for the damning sin of gluttony
    I, as thou seest, am beaten by this shower.
  No solitary woful soul am I,
    For all of these endure the selfsame doom
    For the same fault.' Here ended his reply.
  I answered him, 'O Ciacco, with such gloom
    Thy misery weighs me, I to weep am prone;
    But, if thou canst, declare to what shall come                  60
  The citizens[281] of the divided town.
    Holds it one just man? And declare the cause
    Why 'tis of discord such a victim grown.'
  Then he to me: 'After[282] contentious pause
    Blood will be spilt; the boorish party[283] then
    Will chase the others forth with grievous loss.
  The former it behoves to fall again
    Within three suns, the others to ascend,
    Holpen[284] by him whose wiles ere now are plain.
  Long time, with heads held high, they'll make to bend
    The other party under burdens dire,                             71
    Howe'er themselves in tears and rage they spend.
  There are two just[285] men, at whom none inquire.
    Envy, and pride, and avarice, even these
    Are the three sparks have set all hearts on fire.'
  With this the tearful sound he made to cease:
    And I to him, 'Yet would I have thee tell--
    And of thy speech do thou the gift increase--
  Tegghiaio[286] and Farinata, honourable,
    James Rusticucci,[287] Mosca, Arrigo,                           80
    With all the rest so studious to excel
  In good; where are they? Help me this to know;
    Great hunger for the news hath seizèd me;
    Delights them Heaven, or tortures Hell below?'
  He said: 'Among the blackest souls they be;
    Them to the bottom weighs another sin.
    Shouldst thou so far descend, thou mayst them see.
  But when[288] the sweet world thou again dost win,
    I pray thee bring me among men to mind;
    No more I tell, nor new reply begin.'                           90
  Then his straightforward eyes askance declined;
    He looked at me a moment ere his head
    He bowed; then fell flat 'mong the other blind.
  'Henceforth he waketh not,' my Leader said,
    'Till he shall hear the angel's trumpet sound,
    Ushering the hostile Judge. By every shade
  Its dismal sepulchre shall then be found,
    Its flesh and ancient form it shall resume,
    And list[289] what echoes in eternal round.'
  So passed we where the shades and rainy spume                    100
    Made filthy mixture, with steps taken slow;
    Touching a little on the world to come.[290]
  Wherefore I said: 'Master, shall torments grow
    After the awful sentence hath been heard,
    Or lesser prove and not so fiercely glow?'
  'Repair unto thy Science,'[291] was his word;
    'Which tells, as things approach a perfect state
    To keener joy or suffering they are stirred.
  Therefore although this people cursed by fate
    Ne'er find perfection in its full extent,                      110
    To it they then shall more approximate
  Than now.'[292] Our course we round the circle bent,
    Still holding speech, of which I nothing say,
    Until we came where down the pathway went:
  There found we Plutus, the great enemy.


FOOTNOTES:

[274] _As I move again_: In his swoon he has been conveyed from the
Second Circle down to the Third.

[275] _Cerberus_: In the Greek mythology Cerberus is the watch-dog of
the under world. By Dante he is converted into a demon, and with his
three throats, canine voracity, and ugly inflamed bulk, is appropriately
set to guard the entrance to the circle of the gluttonous and
wine-bibbers.

[276] _And oft, etc._: On entering the circle the shades are seized and
torn by Cerberus; once over-nice in how they fed, they are now treated
as if they were food for dogs. But their enduring pain is to be
subjected to every kind of physical discomfort. Their senses of hearing,
touch, and smell are assailed by the opposite of what they were most
used to enjoy at their luxurious feasts.

[277] _Great worm_: Though human in a monstrous form, Cerberus is so
called as being a disgusting brute.

[278] _Semblances, etc._: 'Emptiness which seems to be a person.' To
this conception of the shades as only seeming to have bodies, Dante has
difficulty in remaining true. For instance, at line 101 they mix with
the sleet to make a sludgy mass; and cannot therefore be impalpable.

[279] Ciacco at once perceives by the weight of Dante's tread that he is
a living man.

[280] _Ciacco_: The name or nickname of a Florentine wit, and, in his
day, a great diner-out. Boccaccio, in his commentary, says that, though
poor, Ciacco associated with men of birth and wealth, especially such as
ate and drank delicately. In the _Decameron_, ix. 8, he is introduced as
being on such terms with the great Corso Donati as to be able to propose
himself to dinner with him. Clearly he was not a bad fellow, and his
pitiful case, perhaps contrasted with the high spirits and jovial
surroundings in which he was last met by Dante, almost, though not
quite, win a tear from the stern pilgrim.

[281] _The citizens, etc._: Dante eagerly confers on Florentine politics
with the first Florentine he encounters in Inferno.

[282] _After, etc._: In the following nine lines the party history of
Florence for two years after the period of the poem (March 1300) is
roughly indicated. The city was divided into two factions--the Whites,
led by the great merchant Vieri dei Cerchi, and the Blacks, led by Corso
Donati, a poor and turbulent noble. At the close of 1300 there was a
bloody encounter between the more violent members of the two parties. In
May 1301 the Blacks were banished. In the autumn of that year they
returned in triumph to the city in the train of Charles of Valois, and
got the Whites banished in April 1302, within three years, that is, of
the poet's talk with Ciacco. Dante himself was associated with the
Whites, but not as a violent partisan; for though he was a strong
politician no party quite answered his views. From the middle of June
till the middle of August 1300 he was one of the Priors. In the course
of 1301 he is believed to have gone on an embassy to Rome to persuade
the Pope to abstain from meddling in Florentine affairs. He never
entered Florence again, being condemned virtually to banishment in
January 1302.

[283] _The boorish party_: _la parte selvaggia_. The Whites; but what is
exactly meant by _selvaggia_ is not clear. Literally it is 'woodland,'
and some say it refers to the Cerchi having originally come from a
well-wooded district; which is absurd. Nor, taking the word in its
secondary meaning of savage, does it apply better to one party than
another--not so well, perhaps, to the Whites as to the Blacks. Villani
also terms the Cerchi _salvatichi_ (viii. 39), and in a connection where
it may mean rude, ill-mannered. I take it that Dante here indulges in a
gibe at the party to which he once belonged, but which, ere he began the
_Comedy_, he had quite broken with. In _Parad._ xvii. 62 he terms the
members of it 'wicked and stupid.' The sneer in the text would come well
enough from the witty and soft-living Ciacco.

[284] _Holpen, etc._: Pope Boniface, already intriguing to gain the
preponderance in Florence, which for a time he enjoyed, with the greedy
and faithless Charles of Valois for his agent.

[285] _Two just_: Dante and another, unknown. He thus distinctly puts
from himself any blame for the evil turn things had taken in Florence.
How thoroughly he had broken with his party ere he wrote this is proved
by his exclusion of the irresolute but respectable Vieri dei Cerchi from
the number of the just men. He, in Dante's judgment, was only too much
listened to.--It will be borne in mind that, at the time assigned to the
action of the _Comedy_, Dante was still resident in Florence.

[286] _Tegghiaio_: See _Inf._ xvi. 42. _Farinata_: _Inf._ x. 32.

[287] _Rusticucci_: _Inf._ xvi. 44. _Mosca_: _Inf._ xxviii. 106.
_Arrigo_: Cannot be identified. All these distinguished Florentines we
may assume to have been hospitable patrons of Ciacco's.

[288] _But when, etc._: In the Inferno many such prayers are addressed
to Dante. The shades in Purgatory ask to have their friends on earth
stirred to offer up petitions for their speedy purification and
deliverance; but the only alleviation possible for the doomed spirits is
to know that they are not yet forgotten up in the 'sweet world.' A
double artistic purpose is served by representing them as feeling thus.
It relieves the mind to think that in such misery there is any source of
comfort at all. And by making them be still interested on their own
account in the thoughts of men, the eager colloquies in which they
engage with Dante on such unequal terms gain in verisimilitude.

[289] _And list, etc._: The final sentence against them is to echo, in
its results, through all eternity.

[290] _The world to come_: The life after doomsday.

[291] _Thy Science_: To Aristotle. In the _Convito_, iv. 16, he quotes
'the Philosopher' as teaching that 'everything is then at its full
perfection when it thoroughly fulfils its special functions.'

[292] _Than now_: Augustine says that 'after the resurrection of the
flesh the joys of the blessed and the sufferings of the wicked will be
enhanced.' And, according to Thomas Aquinas, 'the soul, without the
body, is wanting in the perfection designed for it by Nature.'




CANTO VII.


  Pape[293] Satan! Pape Satan! Aleppe!
    Plutus[294] began in accents rough and hard:
    And that mild Sage, all-knowing, said to me,
  For my encouragement: 'Pay no regard
    Unto thy fear; whatever power he sways
    Thy passage down this cliff shall not be barred.'
  Then turning round to that inflamèd face
    He bade: 'Accursed wolf,[295] at peace remain;
    And, pent within thee, let thy fury blaze.
  Down to the pit we journey not in vain:                           10
    So rule they where by Michael in Heaven's height
    On the adulterous pride[296] was vengeance ta'en.'
  Then as the bellied sails, by wind swelled tight,
    Suddenly drag whenever snaps the mast;
    Such, falling to the ground, the monster's plight.
  To the Fourth Cavern so we downward passed,
    Winning new reaches of the doleful shore
    Where all the vileness of the world is cast.
  Justice of God! which pilest more and more
    Pain as I saw, and travail manifold!                            20
    Why will we sin, to be thus wasted sore?
  As at Charybdis waves are forward rolled
    To break on other billows midway met,
    The people here a counterdance must hold.
  A greater crowd than I had seen as yet,
    With piercing yells advanced on either track,
    Rolling great stones to which their chests were set.
  They crashed together, and then each turned back
    Upon the way he came, while shouts arise,
    'Why clutch it so?' and 'Why to hold it slack?'                 30
  In the dark circle wheeled they on this wise
    From either hand to the opposing part,
    Where evermore they raised insulting cries.
  Thither arrived, each, turning, made fresh start
    Through the half circle[297] a new joust to run;
    And I, stung almost to the very heart,
  Said, 'O my Master, wilt thou make it known
    Who the folk are? Were these all clerks[298] who go
    Before us on the left, with shaven crown?'
  And he replied: 'All of them squinted so                          40
    In mental vision while in life they were,
    They nothing spent by rule. And this they show,
  And with their yelping voices make appear
    When half-way round the circle they have sped,
    And sins opposing them asunder tear.
  Each wanting thatch of hair upon his head
    Was once a clerk, or pope, or cardinal,
    In whom abound the ripest growths of greed.'
  And I: 'O Master, surely among all
    Of these I ought[299] some few to recognise,                    50
    Who by such filthy sins were held in thrall.'
  And he to me: 'Vain thoughts within thee rise;
    Their witless life, which made them vile, now mocks--
    Dimming[300] their faces still--all searching eyes.
  Eternally they meet with hostile shocks;
    These rising from the tomb at last shall stand
    With tight clenched fists, and those with ruined locks.[301]
  Squandering or hoarding, they the happy land[302]
    Have lost, and now are marshalled for this fray;
    Which to describe doth no fine words demand.                    60
  Know hence, my Son, how fleeting is the play
    Of goods at the dispose of Fortune thrown,
    And which mankind to such fierce strife betray.
  Not all the gold which is beneath the moon
    Could purchase peace, nor all that ever was,
    To but one soul of these by toil undone.'
  'Master,' I said, 'tell thou, ere making pause,
    Who Fortune is of whom thou speak'st askance,
    Who holds all worldly riches in her claws.'[303]
  'O foolish creatures, lost in ignorance!'                         70
    He answer made. 'Now see that the reply
    Thou store, which I concerning her advance.
  He who in knowledge is exalted high,
    Framing[304] all Heavens gave such as should them guide,
    That so each part might shine to all; whereby
  Is equal light diffused on every side:
    And likewise to one guide and governor,
    Of worldly splendours did control confide,
  That she in turns should different peoples dower                  79
    With this vain good; from blood should make it pass
    To blood, in spite of human wit. Hence, power,
  Some races failing,[305] other some amass,
    According to her absolute decree
    Which hidden lurks, like serpent in the grass.
  Vain 'gainst her foresight yours must ever be.
    She makes provision, judges, holds her reign,
    As doth his power supreme each deity.
  Her permutations can no truce sustain;
    Necessity[306] compels her to be swift,
    So swift they follow who their turn must gain.                  90
  And this is she whom they so often[307] lift
    Upon the cross, who ought to yield her praise;
    And blame on her and scorn unjustly shift.
  But she is blest nor hears what any says,
    With other primal creatures turns her sphere,
    Jocund and glad, rejoicing in her ways.
  To greater woe now let us downward steer.
    The stars[308] which rose when I began to guide
    Are falling now, nor may we linger here.'
  We crossed the circle to the other side,                         100
    Arriving where a boiling fountain fell
    Into a brooklet by its streams supplied.
  In depth of hue the flood did perse[309] excel,
    And we, with this dim stream to lead us on,
    Descended by a pathway terrible.
  A marsh which by the name of Styx is known,
    Fed by this gloomy brook, lies at the base
    Of threatening cliffs hewn out of cold grey stone.
  And I, intent on study of the place,[310]
    Saw people in that ditch, mud-smeared. In it                   110
    All naked stood with anger-clouded face.
  Nor with their fists alone each fiercely hit
    The other, but with feet and chest and head,
    And with their teeth to shreds each other bit.
  'Son, now behold,' the worthy Master said,
    'The souls of those whom anger made a prize;
    And, further, I would have thee certified
  That 'neath the water people utter sighs,
    And make the bubbles to the surface come;
    As thou mayst see by casting round thine eyes.                 120
  Fixed in the mud they say: "We lived in gloom[311]
    In the sweet air made jocund by the day,
    Nursing within us melancholy fume.
  In this black mud we now our gloom display."
    This hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound,
    Which they in speech unbroken fail to say.'
  And thus about the loathsome pool we wound
    For a wide arc, between the dry and soft,
    With eyes on those who gulp the filth, turned round.
  At last we reached a tower that soared aloft.                    130


FOOTNOTES:

[293] _Pape, etc._: These words have exercised the ingenuity of many
scholars, who on the whole lean to the opinion that they contain an
appeal to Satan against the invasion of his domain. Virgil seems to have
understood them, but the text leaves it doubtful whether Dante himself
did. Later on, but there with an obvious purpose, we find a line of pure
gibberish (_Inf._ xxxi. 67).

[294] _Plutus_: The god of riches; degraded here into a demon. He guards
the Fourth Circle, which is that of the misers and spendthrifts.

[295] _Wolf_: Frequently used by Dante as symbolical of greed.

[296] _Pride_: Which in its way was a kind of greed--that of dominion.
Similarly, the avarice represented by the wolf of Canto i. was seen to
be the lust of aggrandisement. Virgil here answers Plutus's (supposed)
appeal to Satan by referring to the higher Power, under whose protection
he and his companion come.

[297] _The half circle_: This Fourth Circle is divided half-way round
between the misers and spendthrifts, and the two bands at set periods
clash against one another in their vain effort to pass into the section
belonging to the opposite party. Their condition is emblematical of
their sins while in life. They were one-sided in their use of wealth; so
here they can never complete the circle. The monotony of their
employment and of their cries represents their subjection to one idea,
and, as in life, so now, their displeasure is excited by nothing so much
as by coming into contact with the failing opposite to their own. Yet
they are set in the same circle because the sin of both arose from
inordinate desire of wealth, the miser craving it to hoard, and the
spendthrift to spend. In Purgatory also they are placed together (see
_Purg._ xxii. 40). So, on Dante's scheme, liberality is allied to and
dependent on a wise and reasonable frugality.--There is no hint of the
enormous length of the course run by these shades. Far lower down, when
the circles of the Inferno have greatly narrowed, the circuit is
twenty-two miles (_Inf._ xxix. 9).

[298] _Clerks_: Churchmen. The tonsure is the sign that a man is of
ecclesiastical condition. Many took the tonsure who never became
priests.

[299] _I ought, etc._: Dante is astonished that he can pick out no
greedy priest or friar of his acquaintance, when he had known so many.

[300] _Dimming, etc._: Their original disposition is by this time
smothered by the predominance of greed. Dante treats these sinners with
a special contemptuous bitterness. Scores of times since he became
dependent on the generosity of others he must have watched how at a bare
hint the faces of miser and spendthrift fell, while their eyes travelled
vaguely beyond him, and their voices grew cold.

[301] _Ruined locks_: 'A spendthrift will spend his very hair,' says an
Italian proverb.

[302] _The happy land_: Heaven.

[303] _Her claws_: Dante speaks of Fortune as if she were a brutal and
somewhat malicious power. In Virgil's answer there is a refutation of
the opinion of Fortune given by Dante himself, in the _Convito_ (iv.
11). After describing three ways in which the goods of Fortune come to
men he says: 'In each of these three ways her injustice is manifest.'
This part of the _Convito_ Fraticelli seems almost to prove was written
in 1297.

[304] _Framing, etc._: According to the scholastic theory of the world,
each of the nine heavens was directed in its motion by intelligences,
called angels by the vulgar, and by the heathen, gods (_Convito_ ii. 5).
As these spheres and the influences they exercise on human affairs are
under the guidance of divinely-appointed ministers, so, Virgil says, is
the distribution of worldly wealth ruled by Providence through Fortune.

[305] _Some races failing_: It was long believed, nor is the belief
quite obsolete, that one community can gain only at the expense of
another. Sir Thomas Browne says: 'All cannot be happy at once; for
because the glory of one state depends upon the ruin of another, there
is a revolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and all must obey
the swing of that wheel, not moved by intelligences, but by the hand of
God, whereby all states arise to their zeniths and vertical points
according to their predestinated periods.'--_Rel. Med._ i. 17.

[306] _Necessity, etc._: Suggested, perhaps, by Horace's _Te semper
anteit sæva necessitas_ (_Od._ i. 35). The question of how men can be
free in the face of necessity, here associated with Fortune, more than
once emerges in the _Comedy_. Dante's belief on the subject was
substantially that of his favourite author Boethius, who holds that
ultimately 'it is Providence that turns the wheel of all things;' and
who says, that 'if you spread your sails to the wind you will be
carried, not where you would, but whither you are driven by the gale: if
you choose to commit yourself to Fortune, you must endure the manners of
your mistress.'

[307] _Whom they so often, etc._: Treat with contumely.

[308] _The stars, etc._: It is now past midnight, and towards the
morning of Saturday, the 26th of March 1300. Only a few hours have been
employed as yet upon the journey.

[309] _Perse_: 'Perse is a colour between purple and black, but the
black predominates' (_Conv._ iv. 20). The hue of the waters of Styx
agrees with the gloomy temper of the sinners plunged in them.

[310] _The place_: They are now in the Fifth Circle, where the wrathful
are punished.

[311] _In gloom_: These submerged spirits are, according to the older
commentators, the slothful--those guilty of the sin of slackness in the
pursuit of good, as, _e.g._ neglect of the means of grace. This is,
theologically speaking, the sin directly opposed to the active grace of
charity. By more modern critics it has been ingeniously sought to find
in this circle a place not only for the slothful but for the proud and
envious as well. To each of these classes of sinners--such of them as
have repented in this life--a terrace of Purgatory is assigned, and at
first sight it does seem natural to expect that the impenitent among
them should be found in Inferno. But, while in Purgatory souls purge
themselves of every kind of mortal sin, Inferno, as Dante conceived of
it, contains only such sinners as have been guilty of wicked acts. Drift
and bent of heart and mind are taken no account of. The evil seed must
have borne a harvest, and the guilt of every victim of Justice must be
plain and open. Now, pride and envy are sins indeed, but sins that a man
may keep to himself. If they have betrayed the subject of them into the
commission of crimes, in those crimes they are punished lower down, as
is indicated at xii. 49. And so we find that Lucifer is condemned as a
traitor, though his treachery sprang from envy: the greater guilt
includes the less. For sluggishness in the pursuit of good the vestibule
of the caitiffs seems the appropriate place.--There are two kinds of
wrath. One is vehement, and declares itself in violent acts; the other
does not blaze out, but is grudging and adverse to all social good--the
wrath that is nursed. One as much as the other affects behaviour. So in
this circle, as in the preceding, we have represented the two excesses
of one sin.--Dante's theory of sins is ably treated of in Witte's
_Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 121.




CANTO VIII.


  I say, continuing,[312] that long before
    To its foundations we approachèd nigh
    Our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower;
  For, hung out there, two flames[313] we could espy.
    Then at such distance, scarce our eyesight made
    It clearly out, another gave reply.
  And, to the Sea of Knowledge turned, I said:
    'What meaneth this? and what reply would yield
    That other light, and who have it displayed?'
  'Thou shouldst upon the impure watery field,'                     10
    He said, 'already what approaches know,
    But that the fen-fog holds it still concealed.'
  Never was arrow yet from sharp-drawn bow
    Urged through the air upon a swifter flight
    Than what I saw a tiny vessel show,
  Across the water shooting into sight;
    A single pilot served it for a crew,
    Who shouted: 'Art thou come, thou guilty sprite?'[314]
  'O Phlegyas, Phlegyas,[315] this thy loud halloo!
    For once,' my Lord said, 'idle is and vain.                     20
    Thou hast us only till the mud we're through.'
  And, as one cheated inly smarts with pain
    When the deceit wrought on him is betrayed,
    His gathering ire could Phlegyas scarce contain.
  Into the bark my Leader stepped, and made
    Me take my place beside him; nor a jot,
    Till I had entered, was it downward weighed.
  Soon as my Guide and I were in the boat,
    To cleave the flood began the ancient prow,
    Deeper[316] than 'tis with others wont to float.                30
  Then, as the stagnant ditch we glided through,
    One smeared with filth in front of me arose
    And said: 'Thus coming ere thy period,[317] who
  Art thou?' And I: 'As one who forthwith goes
    I come; but thou defiled, how name they thee?'
    'I am but one who weeps,'[318] he said. 'With woes,'
  I answered him, 'with tears and misery,
    Accursèd soul, remain; for thou art known
    Unto me now, all filthy though thou be.'
  Then both his hands were on the vessel thrown;                    40
    But him my wary Master backward heaved,
    Saying: 'Do thou 'mong the other dogs be gone!'
  Then to my neck with both his arms he cleaved,
    And kissed my face, and, 'Soul disdainful,'[319] said,
    'O blessed she in whom thou wast conceived!
  He in the world great haughtiness displayed.
    No deeds of worth his memory adorn;
    And therefore rages here his sinful shade.
  And many are there by whom crowns are worn
    On earth, shall wallow here like swine in mire,                 50
    Leaving behind them names o'erwhelmed[320] in scorn.'
  And I: 'O Master, I have great desire
    To see him well soused in this filthy tide,
    Ere from the lake we finally retire.'
  And he: 'Or ever shall have been descried
    The shore by thee, thy longing shall be met;
    For such a wish were justly gratified.'
  A little after in such fierce onset
    The miry people down upon him bore,
    I praise and bless God for it even yet.                         60
  'Philip Argenti![321] at him!' was the roar;
    And then that furious spirit Florentine
    Turned with his teeth upon himself and tore.
  Here was he left, nor wins more words of mine.
    Now in my ears a lamentation rung,
    Whence I to search what lies ahead begin.
  And the good Master told me: 'Son, ere long
    We to the city called of Dis[322] draw near,
    Where in great armies cruel burghers[323] throng.'
  And I: 'Already, Master, I appear                                 70
    Mosques[324] in the valley to distinguish well,
    Vermilion, as if they from furnace were
  Fresh come.' And he: 'Fires everlasting dwell
    Within them, whence appear they glowing hot,
    As thou discernest in this lower hell.'
  We to the moat profound at length were brought,
    Which girds that city all disconsolate;
    The walls around it seemed of iron wrought.
  Not without fetching first a compass great,
    We came to where with angry cry at last:                        80
    'Get out,' the boatman yelled; 'behold the gate!'[325]
  More than a thousand, who from Heaven[326] were cast,
    I saw above the gates, who furiously
    Demanded: 'Who, ere death on him has passed,
  Holds through the region of the dead his way?'
    And my wise Master made to them a sign
    That he had something secretly to say.
  Then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain,
    And said: 'Come thou, but let that one be gone
    Who thus presumptuous enters on this reign.                     90
  Let him retrace his madcap way alone,
    If he but can; thou meanwhile lingering here,
    Through such dark regions who hast led him down.'
  Judge, reader, if I was not filled with fear,
    Hearing the words of this accursèd threat;
    For of return my hopes extinguished were.
  'Beloved Guide, who more than seven times[327] set
    Me in security, and safely brought
    Through frightful dangers in my progress met,
  Leave me not thus undone;' I him besought:                       100
    'If further progress be to us denied,
    Let us retreat together, tarrying not.'
  The Lord who led me thither then replied:
    'Fear not: by One so great has been assigned
    Our passage, vainly were all hindrance tried.
  Await me here, and let thy fainting mind
    Be comforted and with good hope be fed,
    Not to be left in this low world behind.'
  Thus goes he, thus am I abandonèd
    By my sweet Father. I in doubt remain,                         110
    With Yes and No[328] contending in my head.
  I could not hear what speech he did maintain,
    But no long time conferred he in that place,
    Till, to be first, all inward raced again.
  And then the gates were closed in my Lord's face
    By these our enemies; outside stood he;
    Then backward turned to me with lingering pace,
  With downcast eyes, and all the bravery
    Stripped from his brows; and he exclaimed with sighs;
    'Who dare[329] deny the doleful seats to me!'                  120
  And then he said: 'Although my wrath arise,
    Fear not, for I to victory will pursue,
    Howe'er within they plot, the enterprise.
  This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
    They showed it[330] once at a less secret door
    Which stands unbolted since. Thou didst it view,
  And saw the dark-writ legend which it bore.
    Thence, even now, is one who hastens down
    Through all the circles, guideless, to this shore,
  And he shall win us entrance to the town.'                       130


FOOTNOTES:

[312] _Continuing_: The account of the Fifth Circle, begun in the
preceding Canto, is continued in this. It is impossible to adopt
Boccaccio's story of how the first seven Cantos were found among a heap
of other papers, years after Dante's exile began; and that 'continuing'
marks the resumption of his work. The word most probably suggested the
invention of the incident, or at least led to the identification of some
manuscript that may have been sent to Dante, with the opening pages of
the _Comedy_. If the tale were true, not only must Ciacco's prophecy
(_Inf._ vi.) have been interpolated, but we should be obliged to hold
that Dante began the poem while he was a prosperous citizen.--Boccaccio
himself in his Comment on the _Comedy_ points out the difficulty of
reconciling the story with Ciacco's prophecy.

[313] _Two flames_: Denoting the number of passengers who are to be
conveyed across the Stygian pool. It is a signal for the ferryman, and
is answered by a light hung out on the battlements of the city of Dis.

[314] _Guilty sprite_: Only one is addressed; whether Virgil or Dante is
not clear.

[315] _Phlegyas_: Who burnt the temple of Apollo at Delphi in revenge
for the violation of his daughter by the god.

[316] _Deeper, etc._: Because used to carry only shades.

[317] _Ere thy period_: The curiosity of the shade is excited by the
sinking of the boat in the water. He assumes that Dante will one day be
condemned to Inferno. Neither Francesca nor Ciacco made a like mistake.

[318] _One who weeps_: He is ashamed to tell his name, and hopes in his
vile disguise to remain unknown by Dante, whose Florentine speech and
dress, and perhaps whose features, he has now recognised.

[319] _Soul disdainful_: Dante has been found guilty of here glorying in
the same sin which he so severely reprobates in others. But, without
question, of set purpose he here contrasts righteous indignation with
the ignoble rage punished in this circle. With his quick temper and zeal
so often kindling into flame, he may have felt a special personal need
of emphasising the distinction.

[320] _Names o'erwhelmed, etc._: 'Horrible reproaches.'

[321] _Philip Argenti_: A Florentine gentleman related to the great
family of the Adimari, and a contemporary of Dante's. Boccaccio in his
commentary describes him as a cavalier, very rich, and so ostentatious
that he once shod his horse with silver, whence his surname. In the
_Decameron_ (ix. 8) he is introduced as violently assaulting--tearing
out his hair and dragging him in the mire--the victim of a practical
joke played by the Ciacco of Canto vi. Some, without reason, suppose
that Dante shows such severity to him because he was a Black, and so a
political opponent of his own.

[322] _Dis_: A name of Pluto, the god of the infernal regions.

[323] _Burghers_: The city of Dis composes the Sixth Circle, and, as
immediately appears, is populated by demons. The sinners punished in it
are not mentioned at all in this Canto, and it seems more reasonable to
apply _burghers_ to the demons than to the shades. They are called
_gravi_, generally taken to mean sore burdened, and the description is
then applicable to the shades; but _grave_ also bears the sense of
cruel, and may describe the fierceness of the devils. Though the city is
inhabited by the subjects of Dis, he is found as Lucifer at the very
bottom of the pit. By some critics the whole of the lower Inferno, all
that lies beyond this point, is regarded as being the city of Dis. But
it is the Sixth Circle, with its minarets, that is the city; its walls,
however, serving as bulwarks for all the lower Inferno. The shape of the
city is, of course, that of a circular belt. Here it may be noted that
the Fifth and Sixth Circles are on the same level; the water of Styx,
which as a marsh covers the Fifth, is gathered into a moat to surround
the walls of the Sixth.

[324] _Mosques_: The feature of an Infidel city that first struck
crusader and pilgrim.

[325] _The gate_: They have floated across the stagnant marsh into the
deeper waters of the moat, and up to the gate where Phlegyas is used to
land his passengers. It may be a question whether his services are
required for all who are doomed to the lower Inferno, or only for those
bound to the city.

[326] _From Heaven_: 'Rained from Heaven.' Fallen angels.

[327] _Seven times_: Given as a round number.

[328] _Yes and No_: He will return--He will not return. The demons have
said that Virgil shall remain, and he has promised Dante not to desert
him.

[329] _Who dare, etc._: Virgil knows the hindrance is only temporary,
but wonders what superior devilish power can have incited the demons to
deny him entrance. The incident displays the fallen angels as being
still rebellious, and is at the same time skilfully conceived to mark a
pause before Dante enters on the lower Inferno.

[330] _They showed it, etc._: At the gate of Inferno, on the occasion of
Christ's descent to Limbo. The reference is to the words in the Missal
service for Easter Eve: 'This is the night in which, having burst the
bonds of death, Christ victoriously ascended from Hell.'




CANTO IX.


  The hue which cowardice on my face did paint
    When I beheld my guide return again,
    Put his new colour[331] quicker 'neath restraint.
  Like one who listens did he fixed remain;
    For far to penetrate the air like night,
    And heavy mist, the eye was bent in vain.
  'Yet surely we must vanquish in the fight;'
    Thus he, 'unless[332]--but with such proffered aid--
    O how I weary till he come in sight!'
  Well I remarked how he transition made,                           10
    Covering his opening words with those behind,
    Which contradicted what at first he said.
  Nath'less his speech with terror charged my mind,
    For, haply, to the word which broken fell
    Worse meaning than he purposed, I assigned.
  Down to this bottom[333] of the dismal shell
    Comes ever any from the First Degree,[334]
    Where all their pain is, stripped of hope to dwell?
  To this my question thus responded he:
    'Seldom it haps to any to pursue                                20
    The journey now embarked upon by me.
  Yet I ere this descended, it is true,
    Beneath a spell of dire Erichtho's[335] laid,
    Who could the corpse with soul inform anew.
  Short while my flesh of me was empty made
    When she required me to o'erpass that wall,
    From Judas' circle[336] to abstract a shade.
  That is the deepest, darkest place of all,
    And furthest from the heaven[337] which moves the skies;
    I know the way; fear nought that can befall.                    30
  These fens[338] from which vile exhalations rise
    The doleful city all around invest,
    Which now we reach not save in angry wise.'
  Of more he spake nought in my mind doth rest,
    For, with mine eyes, my every thought had been
    Fixed on the lofty tower with flaming crest,
  Where, in a moment and upright, were seen
    Three hellish furies, all with blood defaced,
    And woman-like in members and in mien.
  Hydras of brilliant green begirt their waist;                     40
    Snakes and cerastes for their tresses grew,
    And these were round their dreadful temples braced.
  That they the drudges were, full well he knew,
    Of her who is the queen of endless woes,
    And said to me: 'The fierce Erynnyes[339] view!
  Herself upon the left Megæra shows;
    That is Alecto weeping on the right;
    Tisiphone's between.' Here made he close.
  Each with her nails her breast tore, and did smite
    Herself with open palms. They screamed in tone                  50
    So fierce, I to the Poet clove for fright.
  'Medusa,[340] come, that we may make him stone!'
    All shouted as they downward gazed; 'Alack!
    Theseus[341] escaped us when he ventured down.'
  'Keep thine eyes closed and turn to them thy back,
    For if the Gorgon chance to be displayed
    And thou shouldst look, farewell the upward track!'
  Thus spake the Master, and himself he swayed
    Me round about; nor put he trust in mine
    But his own hands upon mine eyelids laid.                       60
  O ye with judgment gifted to divine
    Look closely now, and mark what hidden lore
    Lies 'neath the veil of my mysterious line![342]
  Across the turbid waters came a roar
    And crash of sound, which big with fear arose:
    Because of it fell trembling either shore.
  The fashion of it was as when there blows
    A blast by cross heats made to rage amain,
    Which smites the forest and without repose
  The shattered branches sweeps in hurricane;                       70
    In clouds of dust, majestic, onward flies,
    Wild beasts and herdsmen driving o'er the plain.
  'Sharpen thy gaze,' he bade--and freed mine eyes--
    'Across the foam-flecked immemorial lake,
    Where sourest vapour most unbroken lies.'
  And as the frogs before the hostile snake
    Together of the water get them clear,
    And on the dry ground, huddling, shelter take;
  More than a thousand ruined souls in fear
    Beheld I flee from one who, dry of feet,                        80
    Was by the Stygian ferry drawing near.
  Waving his left hand he the vapour beat
    Swiftly from 'fore his face, nor seemed he spent
    Save with fatigue at having this to meet.
  Well I opined that he from Heaven[343] was sent,
    And to my Master turned. His gesture taught
    I should be dumb and in obeisance bent.
  Ah me, how with disdain appeared he fraught!
    He reached the gate, which, touching with a rod,[344]
    He oped with ease, for it resisted not.                         90
  'People despised and banished far from God,'
    Upon the awful threshold then he spoke,
    'How holds in you such insolence abode?
  Why kick against that will which never broke
    Short of its end, if ever it begin,
    And often for you fiercer torments woke?
  Butting 'gainst fate, what can ye hope to win?
    Your Cerberus,[345] as is to you well known,
    Still bears for this a well-peeled throat and chin.'
  Then by the passage foul he back was gone,                       100
    Nor spake to us, but like a man was he
    By other cares[346] absorbed and driven on
  Than that of those who may around him be.
    And we, confiding in the sacred word,
    Moved toward the town in all security.
  We entered without hindrance, and I, spurred
    By my desire the character to know
    And style of place such strong defences gird,
  Entering, begin mine eyes around to throw,
    And see on every hand a vast champaign,                        110
    The teeming seat of torments and of woe.
  And as at Arles[347] where Rhone spreads o'er the plain,
    Or Pola,[348] hard upon Quarnaro sound
    Which bathes the boundaries Italian,
  The sepulchres uneven make the ground;
    So here on every side, but far more dire
    And grievous was the fashion of them found.
  For scattered 'mid the tombs blazed many a fire,
    Because of which these with such fervour burned
    No arts which work in iron more require.                       120
  All of the lids were lifted. I discerned
    By keen laments which from the tombs arose
    That sad and suffering ones were there inurned.
  I said: 'O Master, tell me who are those
    Buried within the tombs, of whom the sighs
    Come to our ears thus eloquent of woes?'
  And he to me: 'The lords of heresies[349]
    With followers of all sects, a greater band
    Than thou wouldst think, these sepulchres comprise.
  To lodge them like to like the tombs are planned.                130
    The sepulchres have more or less of heat.'[350]
    Then passed we, turning to the dexter hand,[351]
  'Tween torments and the lofty parapet.


FOOTNOTES:

[331] _New colour_: Both have changed colour, Virgil in anger and Dante
in fear.

[332] _Unless_: To conceal his misgiving from Dante, Virgil refrains
from expressing all his thought. The 'unless' may refer to what the
lying demons had told him or threatened him with; the 'proffered aid,'
to that involved in Beatrice's request.

[333] _This bottom_: The lower depths of Inferno. How much still lies
below him is unknown to Dante.

[334] _First Degree_: The limbo where Virgil resides. Dante by an
indirect question, seeks to learn how much experience of Inferno is
possessed by his guide.

[335] _Erichtho_: A Thessalian sorceress, of whom Lucan (_Pharsalia_
vi.) tells that she evoked a shade to predict to Sextus Pompey the
result of the war between his father and Cæsar. This happened thirty
years before the death of Virgil.

[336] _Judas' circle_: The Judecca, or very lowest point of the Inferno.
Virgil's death preceded that of Judas by fifty years. He gives no hint
of whose the shade was that he went down to fetch; but Lucan's tale was
probably in Dante's mind. In the Middle Ages the memory of Virgil was
revered as that of a great sorcerer, especially in the neighbourhood of
Naples.

[337] _The heaven, etc._: The _Primum Mobile_; but used here for the
highest heaven. See _Inf._ ii. 83, _note_.

[338] _These fens, etc._: Virgil knows the locality. They have no
choice, but must remain where they are, for the same moat and wall gird
the city all around.

[339] _Erynnyes_: The Furies. The Queen of whom they are handmaids is
Proserpine, carried off by Dis, or Pluto, to the under world.

[340] _Medusa_: One of the Gorgons. Whoever looked on the head of Medusa
was turned into stone.

[341] _Theseus_: Who descended into the infernal regions to rescue
Proserpine, and escaped by the help of Hercules.

[342] _Mysterious line_: 'Strange verses:' That the verses are called
strange, as Boccaccio and others of the older commentators say, because
treating of such a subject in the vulgar tongue for the first time, and
in rhyme, is difficult to believe. Rather they are strange because of
the meaning they convey. What that is, Dante warns the reader of
superior intellect to pause and consider. It has been noted (_Inf._ ii.
28) how he uses the characters of the old mythology as if believing in
their real existence. But this is for his poetical ends. Here he bids us
look below the surface and seek for the truth hidden under the strange
disguise.--The opposition to their progress offered by the powers of
Hell perplexes even Virgil, while Dante is reduced to a state of
absolute terror, and is afflicted with still sharper misgivings than he
had at the first as to the issue of his adventure. By an indirect
question he seeks to learn how much Virgil really knows of the economy
of the lower world; but he cannot so much as listen to all of his
Master's reassuring answer, terrified as he is by the sudden appearance
of the Furies upon the tower, which rises out of the city of unbelief.
These symbolise the trouble of his conscience, and, assailing him with
threats, shake his already trembling faith in the Divine government.
How, in the face of such foes, is he to find the peace and liberty of
soul of which he is in search? That this is the city of unbelief he has
not yet been told, and without knowing it he is standing under the very
walls of Doubting Castle. And now, if he chance to let his eyes rest on
the Gorgon's head, his soul will be petrified by despair; like the
denizens of Hell, he will lose the 'good of the intellect,' and will
pass into a state from which Virgil--or reason--will be powerless to
deliver him. But Virgil takes him in time, and makes him avert his eyes;
which may signify that the only safe course for men is to turn their
backs on the deep and insoluble problem of how the reality of the Divine
government can be reconciled with the apparent triumph of evil.

[343] _From Heaven_: The messenger comes from Heaven, and his words are
holy. Against the obvious interpretation, that he is a good angel, there
lies the objection that no other such is met with in Inferno, and also
that it is spoken of as a new sight for him when Dante first meets with
one in Purgatory. But the obstruction now to be overcome is worthy of
angelic interference; and Dante can hardly be said to meet the
messenger, who does not even glance in his direction. The commentators
have made this angel mean all kind of outlandish things.

[344] _A rod_: A piece of the angelic outfit, derived from the
_caduceus_ of Mercury.

[345] _Cerberus_: Hercules, when Cerberus opposed his entrance to the
infernal regions, fastened a chain round his neck and dragged him to the
gate. The angel's speech answers Dante's doubts as to the limits of
diabolical power.

[346] _By other cares, etc._: It is not in Inferno that Dante is to hold
converse with celestial intelligences. The angel, like Beatrice when she
sought Virgil in Limbo, is all on fire to return to his own place.

[347] _Arles_: The Alyscampo (Elysian Fields) at Arles was an enormous
cemetery, of which ruins still exist. It had a circumference of about
six miles, and contained numerous sarcophagi dating from Roman times.

[348] _Pola_: In Istria, near the Gulf of Quarnaro, said to have
contained many ancient tombs.

[349] _Lords of heresies_: 'Heresiarchs.' Dante now learns for the first
time that Dis is the city of unbelief. Each class of heretics has its
own great sepulchre.

[350] _More or less of heat_: According to the heinousness of the heresy
punished in each. It was natural to associate heretics and punishment by
fire in days when Dominican monks ruled the roast.

[351] _Dexter hand_: As they move across the circles, and down from one
to the other, their course is usually to the left hand. Here for some
reason Virgil turns to the right, so as to have the tombs on the left as
he advances. It may be that a special proof of his knowledge of the
locality is introduced when most needed--after the repulse by the
demons--to strengthen Dante's confidence in him as a guide; or, as some
subtly think, they being now about to enter the abode of heresy, the
movement to the right signifies the importance of the first step in
forming opinion. The only other occasion on which their course is taken
to the right hand is at _Inf._ xvii. 31.




CANTO X.


  And now advance we by a narrow track
    Between the torments and the ramparts high,
    My Master first, and I behind his back.
  'O mighty Virtue,[352] at whose will am I
    Wheeled through these impious circles,' then I said,
    'Speak, and in full my longing satisfy.
  The people who within the tombs are laid,
    May they be seen? The coverings are all thrown
    Open, nor is there[353] any guard displayed.'
  And he to me: 'All shall be fastened down                         10
    When hither from Jehoshaphat[354] they come
    Again in bodies which were once their own.
  All here with Epicurus[355] find their tomb
    Who are his followers, and by whom 'tis held
    That the soul shares the body's mortal doom.
  Things here discovered then shall answer yield,
    And quickly, to thy question asked of me;
    As well as[356] to the wish thou hast concealed.'
  And I: 'Good Leader, if I hide from thee
    My heart, it is that I may little say;                          20
    Nor only now[357] learned I thus dumb to be.'
  'O Tuscan, who, still living, mak'st thy way,
    Modest of speech, through the abode of flame,
    Be pleased[358] a little in this place to stay.
  The accents of thy language thee proclaim
    To be a native of that state renowned
    Which I, perchance, wronged somewhat.' Sudden came
  These words from out a tomb which there was found
    'Mongst others; whereon I, compelled by fright,
    A little toward my Leader shifted ground.                       30
  And he: 'Turn round, what ails thee? Lo! upright
    Beginneth Farinata[359] to arise;
    All of him 'bove the girdle comes in sight.'
  On him already had I fixed mine eyes.
    Towering erect with lifted front and chest,
    He seemed Inferno greatly to despise.
  And toward him I among the tombs was pressed
    By my Guide's nimble and courageous hand,
    While he, 'Choose well thy language,' gave behest.
  Beneath his tomb when I had ta'en my stand                        40
    Regarding me a moment, 'Of what house
    Art thou?' as if in scorn, he made demand.
  To show myself obedient, anxious,
    I nothing hid, but told my ancestors;
    And, listening, he gently raised his brows.[360]
  'Fiercely to me they proved themselves adverse,
    And to my sires and party,' then he said;
    'Because of which I did them twice disperse.'[361]
  I answered him: 'And what although they fled!
    Twice from all quarters they returned with might,               50
    An art not mastered yet by these you[362] led.'
  Beside him then there issued into sight
    Another shade, uncovered to the chin,
    Propped on his knees, if I surmised aright.
  He peered around as if he fain would win
    Knowledge if any other was with me;
    And then, his hope all spent, did thus begin,
  Weeping: 'By dint of genius if it be
    Thou visit'st this dark prison, where my son?
    And wherefore not found in thy company?'                        60
  And I to him: 'I come not here alone:
    He waiting yonder guides me: but disdain
    Of him perchance was by your Guido[363] shown.'
  The words he used, and manner of his pain,
    Revealed his name to me beyond surmise;
    Hence was I able thus to answer plain.
  Then cried he, and at once upright did rise,
    'How saidst thou--was? Breathes he not then the air?
    The pleasant light no longer smites his eyes?'
  When he of hesitation was aware                                   70
    Displayed by me in forming my reply,
    He fell supine, no more to reappear.
  But the magnanimous, at whose bidding I
    Had halted there, the same expression wore,
    Nor budged a jot, nor turned his neck awry.
  'And if'--resumed he where he paused before--
    'They be indeed but slow that art to learn,
    Than this my bed, to hear it pains me more.
  But ere the fiftieth time anew shall burn
    The lady's[364] face who reigneth here below,                   80
    Of that sore art thou shalt experience earn.
  And as to the sweet world again thou'dst go,
    Tell me, why is that people so without
    Ruth for my race,[365] as all their statutes show?'
  And I to him: 'The slaughter and the rout
    Which made the Arbia[366] to run with red,
    Cause in our fane[367] such prayers to be poured out.'
  Whereon he heaved a sigh and shook his head:
    'There I was not alone, nor to embrace
    That cause was I, without good reason, led.                     90
  But there I was alone, when from her place
    All granted Florence should be swept away.
    'Twas I[368] defended her with open face.'
  'So may your seed find peace some better day,'
    I urged him, 'as this knot you shall untie
    In which my judgment doth entangled stay.
  If I hear rightly, ye, it seems, descry
    Beforehand what time brings, and yet ye seem
    'Neath other laws[369] as touching what is nigh.'
  'Like those who see best what is far from them,                  100
    We see things,' said he, 'which afar remain;
    Thus much enlightened by the Guide Supreme.
  To know them present or approaching, vain
    Are all our powers; and save what they relate
    Who hither come, of earth no news we gain.
  Hence mayst thou gather in how dead a state
    Shall all our knowledge from that time be thrown
    When of the future shall be closed the gate.'
  Then, for my fault as if repentant grown,
    I said: 'Report to him who fell supine,                        110
    That still among the living breathes his son.
  And if I, dumb, seemed answer to decline,
    Tell him it was that I upon the knot
    Was pondering then, you helped me to untwine.'
  Me now my Master called, whence I besought
    With more than former sharpness of the shade,
    To tell me what companions he had got.
  He answered me: 'Some thousand here are laid
    With me; 'mong these the Second Frederick,[370]
    The Cardinal[371] too; of others nought be said.'              120
  Then was he hid; and towards the Bard antique
    I turned my steps, revolving in my brain
    The ominous words[372] which I had heard him speak.
  He moved, and as we onward went again
    Demanded of me: 'Wherefore thus amazed?'
    And to his question I made answer plain.
  'Within thy mind let there be surely placed,'
    The Sage bade, 'what 'gainst thee thou heardest say.
    Now mark me well' (his finger here he raised),
  'When thou shalt stand within her gentle ray                     130
    Whose beauteous eye sees all, she will make known
    The stages[373] of thy journey on life's way.'
  Turning his feet, he to the left moved on;
    Leaving the wall, we to the middle[374] went
    Upon a path that to a vale strikes down,
  Which even to us above its foulness sent.


FOOTNOTES:

[352] _Virtue_: Virgil is here addressed by a new title, which, with the
words of deep respect that follow, marks the full restoration of Dante's
confidence in him as his guide.

[353] _Nor is there, etc._: The gate was found to be strictly guarded,
but not so are the tombs.

[354] _Jehoshaphat_: 'I will also gather all nations, and will bring
them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat' (Joel iii. 2).

[355] _Epicurus_: The unbelief in a future life, or rather the
indifference to everything but the calls of ambition and worldly
pleasure, common among the nobles of Dante's age and that preceding it,
went by the name of Epicureanism. It is the most radical of heresies,
because adverse to the first principles of all religions. Dante, in his
treatment of heresy, dwells more on what affects conduct as does the
denial of the Divine government--than on intellectual divergence from
orthodox belief.

[356] _As well as, etc._: The question is: 'May they be seen?' The wish
is a desire to speak with them.

[357] _Nor only now, etc._: Virgil has on previous occasions imposed
silence on Dante, as, for instance, at _Inf._ iii. 51.

[358] _Be pleased, etc._: From one of the sepulchres, to be imagined as
a huge sarcophagus, come words similar to the _Siste Viator!_ common on
Roman tombs.

[359] _Farinata_: Of the great Florentine family of the Uberti, and, in
the generation before Dante, leader of the Ghibeline or Imperialist
party in Florence. His memory long survived among his fellow-townsmen as
that of the typical noble, rough-mannered, unscrupulous, and arrogant;
but yet, for one good action that he did, he at the same time ranked in
the popular estimation as a patriot and a hero. Boccaccio, misled
perhaps by the mention of Epicurus, says that he loved rich and delicate
fare. It is because all his thoughts were worldly that he is condemned
to the city of unbelief. Dante has already (_Inf._ vi. 79) inquired
regarding his fate. He died in 1264.

[360] _His brows_: When Dante tells he is of the Alighieri, a Guelf
family, Farinata shows some slight displeasure. Or, as a modern
Florentine critic interprets the gesture, he has to think a moment
before he can remember on which side the Alighieri ranged
themselves--they being of the small gentry, while he was a great noble,
But this gloss requires Dante to have been more free from pride of
family than he really was.

[361] _Twice disperse_: The Alighieri shared in the exile of the Guelfs
in 1248 and 1260.

[362] _You_: See also line 95. Dante never uses the plural form to a
single person except when desirous of showing social as distinguished
from, or over and above, moral respect.

[363] _Guido_: Farinata's companion in the tomb is Cavalcante
Cavalcanti, who, although a Guelf, was tainted with the more specially
Ghibeline error of Epicureanism. When in order to allay party rancour
some of the Guelf and Ghibeline families were forced to intermarry, his
son Guido took a daughter of Farinata's to wife. This was in 1267, so
that Guido was much older than Dante. Yet they were very intimate, and,
intellectually, had much in common. With him Dante exchanged poems of
occasion, and he terms him more than once in the _Vita Nuova_ his chief
friend. The disdain of Virgil need not mean more than is on the surface.
Guido died in 1301. He is the hero of the _Decameron_, vi. 9.

[364] _The Lady_: Proserpine; _i.e._ the moon. Ere fifty months from
March 1300 were past, Dante was to see the failure of more than one
attempt made by the exiles, of whom he was one, to gain entrance to
Florence. The great attempt was in the beginning of 1304.

[365] _Ruth for my race_: When the Ghibeline power was finally broken in
Florence the Uberti were always specially excluded from any amnesty.
There is mention of the political execution of at least one descendant
of Farinata's. His son when being led to the scaffold said, 'So we pay
our fathers' debts!'--It has been so long common to describe Dante as a
Ghibeline, though no careful writer does it now, that it may be worth
while here to remark that Ghibelinism, as Farinata understood it, was
practically extinct in Florence ere Dante entered political life.

[366] _The Arbia_: At Montaperti, on the Arbia, a few miles from Siena,
was fought in 1260 a great battle between the Guelf Florence and her
allies on the one hand, and on the other the Ghibelines of Florence,
then in exile, under Farinata; the Sienese and Tuscan Ghibelines in
general; and some hundreds of men-at-arms lent by Manfred.
Notwithstanding the gallant behaviour of the Florentine burghers, the
Guelf defeat was overwhelming, and not only did the Arbia run red with
Florentine blood--in a figure--but the battle of Montaperti ruined for a
time the cause of popular liberty and general improvement in Florence.

[367] _Our fane_: The Parliament of the people used to meet in Santa
Reparata, the cathedral; and it is possible that the maintenance of the
Uberti disabilities was there more than once confirmed by the general
body of the citizens. The use of the word is in any case accounted for
by the frequency of political conferences in churches. And the temple
having been introduced, edicts are converted into 'prayers.'

[368] _'Twas I, etc._: Some little time after the victory of Montaperti
there was a great Ghibeline gathering from various cities at Empoli,
when it was proposed, with general approval, to level Florence with the
ground in revenge for the obstinate Guelfism of the population. Farinata
roughly declared that as long as he lived and had a sword he would
defend his native place, and in the face of this protest the resolution
was departed from. It is difficult to understand how of all the
Florentine nobles, whose wealth consisted largely in house property,
Farinata should have stood alone in protesting against the ruin of the
city. But so it seems to have been; and in this great passage Farinata
is repaid for his service, in despite of Inferno.

[369] _Other laws_: Ciacco, in Canto vi., prophesied what was to happen
in Florence, and Farinata has just told him that four years later than
now he will have failed in an attempt to return from exile: yet Farinata
does not know if his family is still being persecuted, and Cavalcanti
fears that his son Guido is already numbered with the dead. Farinata
replies that like the longsighted the shades can only see what is some
distance off, and are ignorant of what is going on, or about to happen;
which seems to imply that they forget what they once foresaw. Guido was
to die within a few months, and the event was too close at hand to come
within the range of his father's vision.

[370] _The Second Frederick_: The Emperor of that name who reigned from
1220 to 1250, and waged a life-long war with the Popes for supremacy in
Italy. It is not however for his enmity with Rome that he is placed in
the Sixth Circle, but for his Epicureanism--as Dante understood it. From
his Sicilian court a spirit of free inquiry spread through the
Peninsula. With men of the stamp of Farinata it would be converted into
a crude materialism.

[371] _The Cardinal_: Ottaviano, of the powerful Tuscan family of the
Ubaldini, a man of great political activity, and known in Tuscany as
'The Cardinal.' His sympathies were not with the Roman Court. The news
of Montaperti filled him with delight, and later, when the Tuscan
Ghibelines refused him money he had asked for, he burst out with 'And
yet I have lost my soul for the Ghibelines--if I have a soul.' He died
not earlier than 1273. After these illustrious names Farinata scorns to
mention meaner ones.

[372] _Ominous words_: Those in which Farinata foretold Dante's exile.

[373] _The stages, etc._: It is Cacciaguida, his ancestor, who in
Paradise instructs Dante in what his future life is to be--one of
poverty and exile (_Parad._ xvii.). This is, however, done at the
request of Beatrice.

[374] _To the middle_: Turning to the left they cut across the circle
till they reach the inner boundary of the city of tombs. Here there is
no wall.




CANTO XI.


  We at the margin of a lofty steep
    Made of great shattered stones in circle bent,
    Arrived where worser torments crowd the deep.
  So horrible a stench and violent
    Was upward wafted from the vast abyss,[375]
    Behind the cover we for shelter went
  Of a great tomb where I saw written this:
    'Pope Anastasius[376] is within me thrust,
    Whom the straight way Photinus made to miss.'
  'Now on our course a while we linger must,'                       10
    The Master said, 'be but our sense resigned
    A little to it, and the filthy gust
  We shall not heed.' Then I: 'Do thou but find
    Some compensation lest our time should run
    Wasted.' And he: 'Behold, 'twas in my mind.
  Girt by the rocks before us, O my son,
    Lie three small circles,'[377] he began to tell,
    'Graded like those with which thou now hast done,
  All of them filled with spirits miserable.
    That sight[378] of them may thee henceforth suffice.            20
    Hear how and wherefore in these groups they dwell.
  Whate'er in Heaven's abhorred as wickedness
    Has injury[379] for its end; in others' bane
    By fraud resulting or in violent wise.
  Since fraud to man alone[380] doth appertain,
    God hates it most; and hence the fraudulent band,
    Set lowest down, endure a fiercer pain.
  Of the violent is the circle next at hand
    To us; and since three ways is violence shown,
    'Tis in three several circuits built and planned.               30
  To God, ourselves, or neighbours may be done
    Violence, or on the things by them possessed;
    As reasoning clear shall unto thee make known.
  Our neighbour may by violence be distressed
    With grievous wounds, or slain; his goods and lands
    By havoc, fire, and plunder be oppressed.
  Hence those who wound and slay with violent hands,
    Robbers, and spoilers, in the nearest round
    Are all tormented in their various bands.
  Violent against himself may man be found,                         40
    And 'gainst his goods; therefore without avail
    They in the next are in repentance drowned
  Who on themselves loss of your world entail,
    Who gamble[381] and their substance madly spend,
    And who when called to joy lament and wail.
  And even to God may violence extend
    By heart denial and by blasphemy,
    Scorning what nature doth in bounty lend.
  Sodom and Cahors[382] hence are doomed to lie
    Within the narrowest circlet surely sealed;                     50
    And such as God within their hearts defy.
  Fraud,[383] 'gainst whose bite no conscience findeth shield,
    A man may use with one who in him lays
    Trust, or with those who no such credence yield.
  Beneath this latter kind of it decays
    The bond of love which out of nature grew;
    Hence, in the second circle[384] herd the race
  To feigning given and flattery, who pursue
    Magic, false coining, theft, and simony,
    Pimps, barrators, and suchlike residue.                         60
  The other form of fraud makes nullity
    Of natural bonds; and, what is more than those,
    The special trust whence men on men rely.
  Hence in the place whereon all things repose,
    The narrowest circle and the seat of Dis,[385]
    Each traitor's gulfed in everlasting woes.'
  'Thy explanation, Master, as to this
    Is clear,' I said, 'and thou hast plainly told
    Who are the people stowed in the abyss.
  But tell why those the muddy marshes hold,                        70
    The tempest-driven, those beaten by the rain,
    And such as, meeting, virulently scold,
  Are not within the crimson city ta'en
    For punishment, if hateful unto God;
    And, if not hateful, wherefore doomed to pain?'
  And he to me: 'Why wander thus abroad,
    More than is wont, thy wits? or how engrossed
    Is now thy mind, and on what things bestowed?
  Hast thou the memory of the passage lost
    In which thy Ethics[386] for their subject treat                80
    Of the three moods by Heaven abhorred the most--
  Malice and bestiality complete;
    And how, compared with these, incontinence
    Offends God less, and lesser blame doth meet?
  If of this doctrine thou extract the sense,
    And call to memory what people are
    Above, outside, in endless penitence,
  Why from these guilty they are sundered far
    Thou shalt discern, and why on them alight
    The strokes of justice in less angry war.'                      90
  'O Sun that clearest every troubled sight,
    So charmed am I by thy resolving speech,
    Doubt yields me joy no less than knowing right.
  Therefore, I pray, a little backward reach,'
    I asked, 'to where thou say'st that usury
    Sins 'gainst God's bounty; and this mystery teach.'
  He said: 'Who gives ear to Philosophy
    Is taught by her, nor in one place alone,
    What nature in her course is governed by,
  Even Mind Divine, and art which thence hath grown;               100
    And if thy Physics[387] thou wilt search within,
    Thou'lt find ere many leaves are open thrown,
  This art by yours, far as your art can win,
    Is followed close--the teacher by the taught;
    As grandchild then to God your art is kin.
  And from these two--do thou recall to thought
    How Genesis[388] begins--should come supplies
    Of food for man, and other wealth be sought.
  And, since another plan the usurer plies,
    Nature and nature's child have his disdain;[389]               110
    Because on other ground his hope relies.
  But come,[390] for to advance I now am fain:
    The Fishes[391] over the horizon line
    Quiver; o'er Caurus now stands all the Wain;
  And further yonder does the cliff decline.'


FOOTNOTES:

[375] _Vast abyss_: They are now at the inner side of the Sixth Circle,
and upon the verge of the rocky steep which slopes down from it into the
Seventh. All the lower Hell lies beneath them, and it is from that
rather than from the next circle in particular that the stench arises,
symbolical of the foulness of the sins which are punished there. The
noisome smells which make part of the horror of Inferno are after this
sometimes mentioned, but never dwelt upon (_Inf._ xviii. 106, and xxix.
50).

[376] _Pope Anastasius_: The second of the name, elected Pope in 496.
Photinus, bishop of Sirenium, was infected with the Sabellian heresy,
but he was deposed more than a century before the time of Anastasius.
Dante follows some obscure legend in charging Anastasius with heresy.
The important point is that the one heretic, in the sense usually
attached to the term, named as being in the city of unbelief, is a Pope.

[377] _Three small circles_: The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth; small in
circumference compared with those above. The pilgrims are now deep in
the hollow cone.

[378] _That sight, etc._: After hearing the following explanation Dante
no longer asks to what classes the sinners met with belong, but only as
to the guilt of individual shades.

[379] _Injury_: They have left above them the circles of those whose sin
consists in the exaggeration or misdirection of a wholesome natural
instinct. Below them lie the circles filled with such as have been
guilty of malicious wickedness. This manifests itself in two ways: by
violence or by fraud. After first mentioning in a general way that the
fraudulent are set lowest in Inferno, Virgil proceeds to define
violence, and to tell how the violent occupy the circle immediately
beneath them--the Seventh. For division of the maliciously wicked into
two classes Dante is supposed to be indebted to Cicero: 'Injury may be
wrought by force or by fraud.... Both are unnatural for man, but fraud
is the more hateful.'--_De Officiis_, i. 13. It is remarkable that
Virgil says nothing of those in the Sixth Circle in this account of the
classes of sinners.

[380] _To man alone, etc._: Fraud involves the corrupt use of the powers
that distinguish us from the brutes.

[381] _Who gamble, etc._: A different sin from the lavish spending
punished in the Fourth Circle (_Inf._ vii.). The distinction is that
between thriftlessness and the prodigality which, stripping a man of the
means of living, disgusts him with life, as described in the following
line. It is from among prodigals that the ranks of suicides are greatly
filled, and here they are appropriately placed together. It may seem
strange that in his classification of guilt Dante should rank violence
to one's self as a more heinous sin than that committed against one's
neighbour. He may have in view the fact that none harm their neighbours
so much as they who are oblivious of their own true interest.

[382] _Sodom and Cahors_: Sins against nature are reckoned sins against
God, as explained lower down in this Canto. Cahors in Languedoc had in
the Middle Ages the reputation of being a nest of usurers. These in old
English Chronicles are termed Caorsins. With the sins of Sodom and
Cahors are ranked the denial of God and blasphemy against Him--deeper
sins than the erroneous conceptions of the Divine nature and government
punished in the Sixth Circle. The three concentric rings composing the
Seventh Circle are all on the same level, as we shall find.

[383] _Fraud, etc._: Fraud is of such a nature that conscience never
fails to give due warning against the sin. This is an aggravation of the
guilt of it.

[384] _The second circle_: The second now beneath them; that is, the
Eighth.

[385] _Seat of Dis_: The Ninth and last Circle.

[386] _Thy Ethics_: The Ethics of Aristotle, in which it is said: 'With
regard to manners, these three things are to be eschewed: incontinence,
vice, and bestiality.' Aristotle holds incontinence to consist in the
immoderate indulgence of propensities which under right guidance are
adapted to promote lawful pleasure. It is, generally speaking, the sin
of which those about whom Dante has inquired were guilty.--It has been
ingeniously sought by Philalethes (_Gött. Com._) to show that Virgil's
disquisition is founded on this threefold classification of
Aristotle's--violence being taken to be the same as bestiality, and
malice as vice. But the reference to Aristotle is made with the limited
purpose of justifying the lenient treatment of incontinence; in the same
way as a few lines further on Genesis is referred to in support of the
harsh treatment of usury.

[387] _Physics_: The Physics of Aristotle, in which it is said: 'Art
imitates nature.' Art includes handicrafts.

[388] _Genesis_: 'And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
garden to dress it and to keep it.' 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread.'

[389] _His disdain_: The usurer seeks to get wealth independently of
honest labour or reliance on the processes of nature. This far-fetched
argument against usury closes one of the most arid passages of the
_Comedy_. The shortness of the Canto almost suggests that Dante had
himself got weary of it.

[390] _But come, etc._: They have been all this time resting behind the
lid of the tomb.

[391] _The Fishes, etc._: The sun being now in Aries the stars of Pisces
begin to rise about a couple of hours before sunrise. The Great Bear
lies above Caurus, the quarter of the N.N.W. wind. It seems impossible
to harmonise the astronomical indications scattered throughout the
_Comedy_, there being traces of Dante's having sometimes used details
belonging rather to the day on which Good Friday fell in 1300, the 8th
of April, than to the (supposed) true anniversary of the crucifixion.
That this, the 25th of March, is the day he intended to conform to
appears from _Inf._ xxi. 112.--The time is now near dawn on the Saturday
morning. It is almost needless to say that Virgil speaks of the stars as
he knows they are placed, but without seeing them. By what light they
see in Inferno is nowhere explained. We have been told that it was dark
as night (_Inf._ iv. 10, v. 28).




CANTO XII.


  The place of our descent[392] before us lay
    Precipitous, and there was something more
    From sight of which all eyes had turned away.
  As at the ruin which upon the shore
    Of Adige[393] fell upon this side of Trent--
    Through earthquake or by slip of what before
  Upheld it--from the summit whence it went
    Far as the plain, the shattered rocks supply
    Some sort of foothold to who makes descent;
  Such was the passage down the precipice high.                     10
    And on the riven gully's very brow
    Lay spread at large the Cretan Infamy[394]
  Which was conceived in the pretended cow.
    Us when he saw, he bit himself for rage
    Like one whose anger gnaws him through and through.
  'Perhaps thou deemest,' called to him the Sage,
    'This is the Duke of Athens[395] drawing nigh,
    Who war to the death with thee on earth did wage.
  Begone, thou brute, for this one passing by
    Untutored by thy sister has thee found,                         20
    And only comes thy sufferings to spy,'
  And as the bull which snaps what held it bound
    On being smitten by the fatal blow,
    Halts in its course, and reels upon the ground,
  The Minotaur I saw reel to and fro;
    And he, the alert, cried: 'To the passage haste;
    While yet he chafes 'twere well thou down shouldst go.'
  So we descended by the slippery waste[396]
    Of shivered stones which many a time gave way
    'Neath the new weight[397] my feet upon them placed.            30
  I musing went; and he began to say:
    'Perchance this ruined slope thou thinkest on,
    Watched by the brute rage I did now allay.
  But I would have thee know, when I came down
    The former time[398] into this lower Hell,
    The cliff had not this ruin undergone.
  It was not long, if I distinguish well,
    Ere He appeared who wrenched great prey from Dis[399]
    From out the upmost circle. Trembling fell
  Through all its parts the nauseous abyss                          40
    With such a violence, the world, I thought,
    Was stirred by love; for, as they say, by this
  She back to Chaos[400] has been often brought.
    And then it was this ancient rampart strong
    Was shattered here and at another spot.[401]
  But toward the valley look. We come ere long
    Down to the river of blood[402] where boiling lie
    All who by violence work others wrong.'
  O insane rage! O blind cupidity!
    By which in our brief life we are so spurred,                   50
    Ere downward plunged in evil case for aye!
  An ample ditch I now beheld engird
    And sweep in circle all around the plain,
    As from my Escort I had lately heard.
  Between this and the rock in single train
    Centaurs[403] were running who were armed with bows,
    As if they hunted on the earth again.
  Observing us descend they all stood close,
    Save three of them who parted from the band
    With bow, and arrows they in coming chose.                      60
  'What torment,' from afar one made demand,
    'Come ye to share, who now descend the hill?
    I shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand.'
  My Master said: 'We yield no answer till
    We come to Chiron[404] standing at thy side;
    But thy quick temper always served thee ill.'
  Then touching me: ''Tis Nessus;[405] he who died
    With love for beauteous Dejanire possessed,
    And who himself his own vendetta plied.
  He in the middle, staring on his breast,                          70
    Is mighty Chiron, who Achilles bred;
    And next the wrathful Pholus. They invest
  The fosse and in their thousands round it tread,
    Shooting whoever from the blood shall lift,
    More than his crime allows, his guilty head.'
  As we moved nearer to those creatures swift
    Chiron drew forth a shaft and dressed his beard
    Back on his jaws, using the arrow's cleft.
  And when his ample mouth of hair was cleared,
    He said to his companions: 'Have ye seen                        80
    The things the second touches straight are stirred,
  As they by feet of shades could ne'er have been?'
    And my good Guide, who to his breast had gone--
    The part where join the natures,[406] 'Well I ween
  He lives,' made answer; 'and if, thus alone,
    He seeks the valley dim 'neath my control,
    Necessity, not pleasure, leads him on.
  One came from where the alleluiahs roll,
    Who charged me with this office strange and new:
    No robber he, nor mine a felon soul.                            90
  But, by that Power which makes me to pursue
    The rugged journey whereupon I fare,
    Accord us one of thine to keep in view,
  That he may show where lies the ford, and bear
    This other on his back to yonder strand;
    No spirit he, that he should cleave the air.'
  Wheeled to the right then Chiron gave command
    To Nessus: 'Turn, and lead them, and take tent
    They be not touched by any other band.'[407]
  We with our trusty Escort forward went,                          100
    Threading the margin of the boiling blood
    Where they who seethed were raising loud lament.
  People I saw up to the chin imbrued,
    'These all are tyrants,' the great Centaur said,
    'Who blood and plunder for their trade pursued.
  Here for their pitiless deeds tears now are shed
    By Alexander,[408] and Dionysius fell,
    Through whom in Sicily dolorous years were led.
  The forehead with black hair so terrible
    Is Ezzelino;[409] that one blond of hue,                       110
    Obizzo[410] d'Este, whom, as rumours tell,
  His stepson murdered, and report speaks true.'
    I to the Poet turned, who gave command:
    'Regard thou chiefly him. I follow you.'
  Ere long the Centaur halted on the strand,
    Close to a people who, far as the throat,
    Forth of that bulicamë[411] seemed to stand.
  Thence a lone shade to us he pointed out
    Saying: 'In God's house[412] ran he weapon through
    The heart which still on Thames wins cult devout.'             120
  Then I saw people, some with heads in view,
    And some their chests above the river bore;
    And many of them I, beholding, knew.
  And thus the blood went dwindling more and more,
    Until at last it covered but the feet:
    Here took we passage[413] to the other shore.
  'As on this hand thou seest still abate
    In depth the volume of the boiling stream,'
    The Centaur said, 'so grows its depth more great,
  Believe me, towards the opposite extreme,                        130
    Until again its circling course attains
    The place where tyrants must lament. Supreme
  Justice upon that side involves in pains,
    With Attila,[414] once of the world the pest,
    Pyrrhus[415] and Sextus: and for ever drains
  Tears out of Rinier of Corneto[416] pressed
    And Rinier Pazzo[417] in that boiling mass,
    Whose brigandage did so the roads infest.'
  Then turned he back alone, the ford to pass.


FOOTNOTES:

[392] _Our descent_: To the Seventh Circle.

[393] _Adige_: Different localities in the valley of the Adige have been
fixed on as the scene of this landslip. The Lavini di Marco, about
twenty miles south of Trent, seem best to answer to the description.
They 'consist of black blocks of stone and fragments of a landslip
which, according to the Chronicle of Fulda, fell in the year 883 and
overwhelmed the valley for four Italian miles' (Gsell-Fels, _Ober.
Ital._ i. 35).

[394] _The Cretan Infamy_: The Minotaur, the offspring of Pasiphaë; a
half-bovine monster who inhabited the Cretan labyrinth, and to whom a
human victim was offered once a year. He lies as guard upon the Seventh
Circle--that of the violent (_Inf._ xi. 23, _note_)--and is set at the
top of the rugged slope, itself the scene of a violent convulsion.

[395] _Duke of Athens_: Theseus, instructed by Ariadne, daughter of
Pasiphaë and Minos, how to outwit the Minotaur, entered the labyrinth in
the character of a victim, slew the monster, and then made his way out,
guided by a thread he had unwound as he went in.

[396] _The slippery waste_: The word used here, _scarco_, means in
modern Tuscan a place where earth or stones have been carelessly shot
into a heap.

[397] _The new weight_: The slope had never before been trodden by
mortal foot.

[398] _The former time_: When Virgil descended to evoke a shade from the
Ninth Circle (_Inf._ ix. 22).

[399] _Prey from Dis_: The shades delivered from Limbo by Christ (_Inf._
iv. 53). The expression in the text is probably suggested by the words
of the hymn _Vexilla: Prædamque tulit Tartaris_.

[400] _To Chaos_: The reference is to the theory of Empedocles, known to
Dante through the refutation of it by Aristotle. The theory was one of
periods of unity and division in nature, according as love or hatred
prevailed.

[401] _Another spot_: See _Inf._ xxi. 112. The earthquake at the
Crucifixion shook even Inferno to its base.

[402] _The river of blood_: Phlegethon, the 'boiling river.' Styx and
Acheron have been already passed. Lethe, the fourth infernal river, is
placed by Dante in Purgatory. The first round or circlet of the Seventh
Circle is filled by Phlegethon.

[403] _Centaurs_: As this round is the abode of such as are guilty of
violence against their neighbours, it is guarded by these brutal
monsters, half-man and half-horse.

[404] _Chiron_: Called the most just of the Centaurs.

[405] _Nessus_: Slain by Hercules with a poisoned arrow. When dying he
gave Dejanira his blood-stained shirt, telling her it would insure the
faithfulness to her of any whom she loved. Hercules wore it and died of
the venom; and thus Nessus avenged himself.

[406] The natures: The part of the Centaur where the equine body is
joined on to the human neck and head.

[407] _Other band_: Of Centaurs.

[408] _Alexander_: It is not known whether Alexander the Great or a
petty Thessalian tyrant is here meant. _Dionysius_: The cruel tyrant of
Syracuse.

[409] _Ezzelino_: Or Azzolino of Romano, the greatest Lombard Ghibeline
of his time. He was son-in-law of Frederick II., and was Imperial Vicar
of the Trevisian Mark. Towards the close of Fredrick's life, and for
some years after, he exercised almost independent power in Vicenza,
Padua, and Verona. Cruelty, erected into a system, was his chief
instrument of government, and 'in his dungeons men found something worse
than death.' For Italians, says Burckhardt, he was the most impressive
political personage of the thirteenth century; and around his memory, as
around Frederick's, there gathered strange legends. He died in 1259, of
a wound received in battle. When urged to confess his sins by the monk
who came to shrive him, he declared that the only sin on his conscience
was negligence in revenge. But this may be mythical, as may also be the
long black hair between his eyebrows, which rose up stiff and terrible
as his anger waxed.

[410] _Obizzo_: The second Marquis of Este of that name. He was lord of
Ferrara. There seems little, if any, evidence extant of his being
specially cruel. As a strong Guelf he took sides with Charles of Anjou
against Manfred. He died in 1293, smothered, it was believed, by a son,
here called a stepson for his unnatural conduct. But though Dante
vouches for the truth of the rumour it seems to have been an invention.

[411] _That bulicamë_: The stream of boiling blood is probably named
from the bulicamë, or hot spring, best known to Dante--that near Viterbo
(see _Inf._ xiv. 79). And it may be that the mention of the bulicamë
suggests the reference at line 119.

[412] _In God's house_: Literally, 'In the bosom of God.' The shade is
that of Guy, son of Simon of Montfort and Vicar in Tuscany of Charles of
Anjou. In 1271 he stabbed, in the Cathedral of Viterbo, Henry, son of
Richard of Cornwall and cousin of Edward I. of England. The motive of
the murder was to revenge the death of his father, Simon, at Evesham.
The body of the young prince was conveyed to England, and the heart was
placed in a vase upon the tomb of the Confessor. The shade of Guy stands
up to the chin in blood among the worst of the tyrants, and alone,
because of the enormity of his crime.

[413] _Here took we passage_: Dante on Nessus' back. Virgil has fallen
behind to allow the Centaur to act as guide; and how he crosses the
stream Dante does not see.

[414] _Attila_: King of the Huns, who invaded part of Italy in the fifth
century; and who, according to the mistaken belief of Dante's age, was
the devastator of Florence.

[415] _Pyrrhus_: King of Epirus. _Sextus_: Son of Pompey; a great
sea-captain who fought against the Triumvirs. The crime of the first, in
Dante's eyes, is that he fought with Rome; of the second, that he
opposed Augustus.

[416] _Rinier of Corneto_: Who in Dante's time disturbed the coast of
the States of the Church by his robberies and violence.

[417] _Rinier Pazzo_: Of the great family of the Pazzi of Val d'Arno,
was excommunicated in 1269 for robbing ecclesiastics.




CANTO XIII.


  Ere Nessus landed on the other shore
    We for our part within a forest[418] drew,
    Which of no pathway any traces bore.
  Not green the foliage, but of dusky hue;
    Not smooth the boughs, but gnarled and twisted round;
    For apples, poisonous thorns upon them grew.
  No rougher brakes or matted worse are found
    Where savage beasts betwixt Corneto[419] roam
    And Cecina,[419] abhorring cultured ground.
  The loathsome Harpies[420] nestle here at home,                   10
    Who from the Strophades the Trojans chased
    With dire predictions of a woe to come.
  Great winged are they, but human necked and faced,
    With feathered belly, and with claw for toe;
    They shriek upon the bushes wild and waste.
  'Ere passing further, I would have thee know,'
    The worthy Master thus began to say,
    'Thou'rt in the second round, nor hence shalt go
  Till by the horrid sand thy footsteps stay.
    Give then good heed, and things thou'lt recognise               20
    That of my words will prove[421] the verity.'
  Wailings on every side I heard arise:
    Of who might raise them I distinguished nought;
    Whereon I halted, smitten with surprise.
  I think he thought that haply 'twas my thought
    The voices came from people 'mong the trees,
    Who, to escape us, hiding-places sought;
  Wherefore the Master said: 'From one of these
    Snap thou a twig, and thou shalt understand
    How little with thy thought the fact agrees.'                   30
  Thereon a little I stretched forth my hand
    And plucked a tiny branch from a great thorn.
    'Why dost thou tear me?' made the trunk demand.
  When dark with blood it had begun to turn,
    It cried a second time: 'Why wound me thus?
    Doth not a spark of pity in thee burn?
  Though trees we be, once men were all of us;
    Yet had our souls the souls of serpents been
    Thy hand might well have proved more piteous.'
  As when the fire hath seized a fagot green                        40
    At one extremity, the other sighs,
    And wind, escaping, hisses; so was seen,
  At where the branch was broken, blood to rise
    And words were mixed with it. I dropped the spray
    And stood like one whom terror doth surprise.
  The Sage replied: 'Soul vexed with injury,
    Had he been only able to give trust
    To what he read narrated in my lay,[422]
  His hand toward thee would never have been thrust.
    'Tis hard for faith; and I, to make it plain,                   50
    Urged him to trial, mourn it though I must.
  But tell him who thou wast; so shall remain
    This for amends to thee, thy fame shall blow
    Afresh on earth, where he returns again.'
  And then the trunk: 'Thy sweet words charm me so,
    I cannot dumb remain; nor count it hard
    If I some pains upon my speech bestow.
  For I am he[423] who held both keys in ward
    Of Frederick's heart, and turned them how I would,
    And softly oped it, and as softly barred,                       60
  Till scarce another in his counsel stood.
    To my high office I such loyalty bore,
    It cost me sleep and haleness of my blood.
  The harlot[424] who removeth nevermore
    From Cæsar's house eyes ignorant of shame--
    A common curse, of courts the special sore--
  Set against me the minds of all aflame,
    And these in turn Augustus set on fire,
    Till my glad honours bitter woes became.
  My soul, filled full with a disdainful ire,                       70
    Thinking by means of death disdain to flee,
    'Gainst my just self unjustly did conspire.
  I swear even by the new roots of this tree
    My fealty to my lord I never broke,
    For worthy of all honour sure was he.
  If one of you return 'mong living folk,
    Let him restore my memory, overthrown
    And suffering yet because of envy's stroke.'
  Still for a while the poet listened on,
    Then said: 'Now he is dumb, lose not the hour,                  80
    But make request if more thou'dst have made known.'
  And I replied: 'Do thou inquire once more
    Of what thou thinkest[425] I would gladly know;
    I cannot ask; ruth wrings me to the core.'
  On this he spake: 'Even as the man shall do,
    And liberally, what thou of him hast prayed,
    Imprisoned spirit, do thou further show
  How with these knots the spirits have been made
    Incorporate; and, if thou canst, declare
    If from such members e'er is loosed a shade.'                   90
  Then from the trunk came vehement puffs of air;
    Next, to these words converted was the wind:
    'My answer to you shall be short and clear.
  When the fierce soul no longer is confined
    In flesh, torn thence by action of its own,
    To the Seventh Depth by Minos 'tis consigned.
  No choice is made of where it shall be thrown
    Within the wood; but where by chance 'tis flung
    It germinates like seed of spelt that's sown.
  A forest tree it grows from sapling young;                       100
    Eating its leaves, the Harpies cause it pain,
    And open loopholes whence its sighs are wrung.
  We for our vestments shall return again
    Like others, but in them shall ne'er be clad:[426]
    Men justly lose what from themselves they've ta'en.
  Dragged hither by us, all throughout the sad
    Forest our bodies shall be hung on high;
    Each on the thorn of its destructive shade.'
  While to the trunk we listening lingered nigh,
    Thinking he might proceed to tell us more,                     110
    A sudden uproar we were startled by
  Like him who, that the huntsman and the boar
    To where he stands are sweeping in the chase,
    Knows by the crashing trees and brutish roar.
  Upon our left we saw a couple race
    Naked[427] and scratched; and they so quickly fled
    The forest barriers burst before their face.
  'Speed to my rescue, death!' the foremost pled.
    The next, as wishing he could use more haste;
    'Not thus, O Lano,[428] thee thy legs bested                   120
  When one at Toppo's tournament thou wast.'
    Then, haply wanting breath, aside he stepped,
    Merged with a bush on which himself he cast.
  Behind them through the forest onward swept
    A pack of dogs, black, ravenous, and fleet,
    Like greyhounds from their leashes newly slipped.
  In him who crouched they made their teeth to meet,
    And, having piecemeal all his members rent,
    Haled them away enduring anguish great.
  Grasping my hand, my Escort forward went                         130
    And led me to the bush which, all in vain,
    Through its ensanguined openings made lament.
  'James of St. Andrews,'[429] it we heard complain;
    'What profit hadst thou making me thy shield?
    For thy bad life doth blame to me pertain?'
  Then, halting there, this speech my Master held:
    'Who wast thou that through many wounds dost sigh,
    Mingled with blood, words big with sorrow swelled?'
  'O souls that hither come,' was his reply,
    'To witness shameful outrage by me borne,                      140
    Whence all my leaves torn off around me lie,
  Gather them to the root of this drear thorn.
    My city[430] for the Baptist changed of yore
    Her former patron; wherefore, in return,
  He with his art will make her aye deplore;
    And were it not some image doth remain
    Of him where Arno's crossed from shore to shore,
  Those citizens who founded her again
    On ashes left by Attila,[431] had spent
    Their labour of a surety all in vain.                          150
  In my own house[432] I up a gibbet went.'


FOOTNOTES:

[418] _A forest_: The second round of the Seventh Circle consists of a
belt of tangled forest, enclosed by the river of blood, and devoted to
suicides and prodigals.

[419] _Corneto and Cecina_: Corneto is a town on the coast of what used
to be the States of the Church; Cecina a stream not far south of
Leghorn. Between them lies the Maremma, a district of great natural
fertility, now being restored again to cultivation, but for ages a
neglected and poisonous wilderness.

[420] _Harpies_: Monsters with the bodies of birds and the heads of
women. In the _Æneid_ iii., they are described as defiling the feast of
which the Trojans were about to partake on one of the
Strophades--islands of the Ægean; and on that occasion the prophecy was
made that Æneas and his followers should be reduced to eat their tables
ere they acquired a settlement in Italy. Here the Harpies symbolise
shameful waste and disgust with life.

[421] _Will prove, etc._: The things seen by Dante are to make credible
what Virgil tells (_Æn._ iii.) of the blood and piteous voice that
issued from the torn bushes on the tomb of Polydorus.

[422] _My lay_: See previous note. Dante thus indirectly acknowledges
his debt to Virgil; and, perhaps, at the same time puts in his claim to
an imaginative licence equal to that taken by his master. On a modern
reader the effect of the reference is to weaken the verisimilitude of
the incident.

[423] _For I am he, etc._: The speaker is Pier delle Vigne, who from
being a begging student of Bologna rose to be the Chancellor of the
Emperor Frederick II., the chief councillor of that monarch, and one of
the brightest ornaments of his intellectual court. Peter was perhaps the
more endeared to his master because, like him, he was a poet of no mean
order. There are two accounts of what caused his disgrace. According to
one of these he was found to have betrayed Frederick's interests in
favour of the Pope's; and according to the other he tried to poison him.
Neither is it known whether he committed suicide; though he is said to
have done so after being disgraced, by dashing his brains out against a
church wall in Pisa. Dante clearly follows this legend. The whole
episode is eloquent of the esteem in which Peter's memory was held by
Dante. His name is not mentioned in Inferno, but yet the promise is
amply kept that it shall flourish on earth again, freed from unmerited
disgrace. He died about 1249.

[424] _The harlot_: Envy.

[425] _Of what thou thinkest, etc._: Virgil never asks a question for
his own satisfaction. He knows who the spirits are, what brought them
there, and which of them will speak honestly out on the promise of
having his fame refreshed in the world. It should be noted how, by a
hint, he has made Peter aware of who he is (line 48); a delicate
attention yielded to no other shade in the Inferno, except Ulysses
(_Inf._ xxvi. 79), and, perhaps, Brunetto Latini (_Inf._ xv. 99).

[426] _In them shall ne'er be clad_: Boccaccio is here at great pains to
save Dante from a charge of contradicting the tenet of the resurrection
of the flesh.

[427] _Naked_: These are the prodigals; their nakedness representing the
state to which in life they had reduced themselves.

[428] _Lano_: Who made one of a club of prodigals in Siena (_Inf._ xxix.
130) and soon ran through his fortune. Joining in a Florentine
expedition in 1288 against Arezzo, he refused to escape from a defeat
encountered by his side at Pieve del Toppo, preferring, as was supposed,
to end his life at once rather than drag it out in poverty.

[429] _James of St. Andrews_: Jacopo da Sant' Andrea, a Paduan who
inherited enormous wealth which did not last him for long. He literally
threw money away, and would burn a house for the sake of the blaze. His
death has been placed in 1239.

[430] _My city, etc._: According to tradition the original patron of
Florence was Mars. In Dante's time an ancient statue, supposed to be of
that god, stood upon the Old Bridge of Florence. It is referred to in
_Parad._ xvi. 47 and 145. Benvenuto says that he had heard from
Boccaccio, who had frequently heard it from old people, that the statue
was regarded with great awe. If a boy flung stones or mud at it, the
bystanders would say of him that he would make a bad end. It was lost in
the great flood of 1333. Here the Florentine shade represents Mars as
troubling Florence with wars in revenge for being cast off as a patron.

[431] _Attila_: A confusion with Totila. Attila was never so far south
as Tuscany. Neither is there reason to believe that when Totila took the
city he destroyed it. But the legend was that it was rebuilt in the time
of Charles the Great.

[432] _My own house, etc._: It is not settled who this was who hanged
himself from the beams of his own roof. One of the Agli, say some;
others, one of the Mozzi. Boccaccio and Peter Dante remark that suicide
by hanging was common in Florence. But Dante's text seems pretty often
to have suggested the invention of details in support or illustration of
it.




CANTO XIV.


  Me of my native place the dear constraint[433]
    Led to restore the leaves which round were strewn,
    To him whose voice by this time was grown faint.
  Thence came we where the second round joins on
    Unto the third, wherein how terrible
    The art of justice can be, is well shown.
  But, clearly of these wondrous things to tell,
    I say we entered on a plain of sand
    Which from its bed doth every plant repel.
  The dolorous wood lies round it like a band,                      10
    As that by the drear fosse is circled round.
    Upon its very edge we came to a stand.
  And there was nothing within all that bound
    But burnt and heavy sand; like that once trod
    Beneath the feet of Cato[434] was the ground.
  Ah, what a terror, O revenge of God!
    Shouldst thou awake in any that may read
    Of what before mine eyes was spread abroad.
  I of great herds of naked souls took heed.
    Most piteously was weeping every one;                           20
    And different fortunes seemed to them decreed.
  For some of them[435] upon the ground lay prone,
    And some were sitting huddled up and bent,
    While others, restless, wandered up and down.
  More numerous were they that roaming went
    Than they that were tormented lying low;
    But these had tongues more loosened to lament.
  O'er all the sand, deliberate and slow,
    Broad open flakes of fire were downward rained,
    As 'mong the Alps[436] in calm descends the snow.               30
  Such Alexander[437] saw when he attained
    The hottest India; on his host they fell
    And all unbroken on the earth remained;
  Wherefore he bade his phalanxes tread well
    The ground, because when taken one by one
    The burning flakes they could the better quell.
  So here eternal fire[438] was pouring down;
    As tinder 'neath the steel, so here the sands
    Kindled, whence pain more vehement was known.
  And, dancing up and down, the wretched hands[439]                 40
    Beat here and there for ever without rest;
    Brushing away from them the falling brands.
  And I: 'O Master, by all things confessed
    Victor, except by obdurate evil powers
    Who at the gate[440] to stop our passage pressed,
  Who is the enormous one who noway cowers
    Beneath the fire; with fierce disdainful air
    Lying as if untortured by the showers?'
  And that same shade, because he was aware
    That touching him I of my Guide was fain                        50
    To learn, cried: 'As in life, myself I bear
  In death. Though Jupiter should tire again
    His smith, from whom he snatched in angry bout
    The bolt by which I at the last was slain;[441]
  Though one by one he tire the others out
    At the black forge in Mongibello[442] placed,
    While "Ho, good Vulcan, help me!" he shall shout--
  The cry he once at Phlegra's[443] battle raised;
    Though hurled with all his might at me shall fly
    His bolts, yet sweet revenge he shall not taste.'               60
  Then spake my Guide, and in a voice so high
    Never till then heard I from him such tone:
    'O Capaneus, because unquenchably
  Thy pride doth burn, worse pain by thee is known.
    Into no torture save thy madness wild
    Fit for thy fury couldest thou be thrown.'
  Then, to me turning with a face more mild,
    He said: 'Of the Seven Kings was he of old,
    Who leaguered Thebes, and as he God reviled
  Him in small reverence still he seems to hold;                    70
    But for his bosom his own insolence
    Supplies fit ornament,[444] as now I told.
  Now follow; but take heed lest passing hence
    Thy feet upon the burning sand should tread;
    But keep them firm where runs the forest fence.'[445]
  We reached a place--nor any word we said--
    Where issues from the wood a streamlet small;
    I shake but to recall its colour red.
  Like that which does from Bulicamë[446] fall,
    And losel women later 'mong them share;                         80
    So through the sand this brooklet's waters crawl.
  Its bottom and its banks I was aware
    Were stone, and stone the rims on either side.
    From this I knew the passage[447] must be there.
  'Of all that I have shown thee as thy guide
    Since when we by the gateway[448] entered in,
    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
  Nothing by thee has yet encountered been
    So worthy as this brook to cause surprise,
    O'er which the falling fire-flakes quenched are seen.'          90
  These were my Leader's words. For full supplies
    I prayed him of the food of which to taste
    Keen appetite he made within me rise.
  'In middle sea there lies a country waste,
    Known by the name of Crete,' I then was told,
    'Under whose king[449] the world of yore was chaste.
  There stands a mountain, once the joyous hold
    Of woods and streams; as Ida 'twas renowned,
    Now 'tis deserted like a thing grown old.
  For a safe cradle 'twas by Rhea found.                           100
    To nurse her child[450] in; and his infant cry,
  Lest it betrayed him, she with clamours drowned.
  Within the mount an old man towereth high.
    Towards Damietta are his shoulders thrown;
    On Rome, as on his mirror, rests his eye.
  His head is fashioned of pure gold alone;
    Of purest silver are his arms and chest;
    'Tis brass to where his legs divide; then down
  From that is all of iron of the best,
    Save the right foot, which is of baken clay;                   110
    And upon this foot doth he chiefly rest.
  Save what is gold, doth every part display
    A fissure dripping tears; these, gathering all
    Together, through the grotto pierce a way.
  From rock to rock into this deep they fall,
    Feed Acheron[451] and Styx and Phlegethon,
    Then downward travelling by this strait canal,
  Far as the place where further slope is none,
    Cocytus form; and what that pool may be
    I say not now. Thou'lt see it further on.'                     120
  'If this brook rises,' he was asked by me,
    'Within our world, how comes it that no trace
    We saw of it till on this boundary?'
  And he replied: 'Thou knowest that the place
    Is round, and far as thou hast moved thy feet,
    Still to the left hand[452] sinking to the base,
  Nath'less thy circuit is not yet complete.
    Therefore if something new we chance to spy,
    Amazement needs not on thy face have seat.'
  I then: 'But, Master, where doth Lethe lie,                      130
    And Phlegethon? Of that thou sayest nought;
    Of this thou say'st, those tears its flood supply.'
  'It likes me well to be by thee besought;
    But by the boiling red wave,' I was told,
    'To half thy question was an answer brought.
  Lethe,[453] not in this pit, shalt thou behold.
    Thither to wash themselves the spirits go,
    When penitence has made them spotless souled.'
  Then said he: 'From the wood 'tis fitting now
    That we depart; behind me press thou nigh.                     140
    Keep we the margins, for they do not glow,
  And over them, ere fallen, the fire-flakes die.'


FOOTNOTES:

[433] _Dear constraint_: The mention of Florence has awakened Dante to
pity, and he willingly complies with the request of the unnamed suicide
(_Inf._ xiii. 142). As a rule, the only service he consents to yield the
souls with whom he converses in Inferno is to restore their memory upon
earth; a favour he does not feign to be asked for in this case, out of
consideration, it may be, for the family of the sinner.

[434] _Cato_: Cato of Utica, who, after the defeat of Pompey at
Pharsalia, led his broken army across the Libyan desert to join King
Juba.

[435] _Some of them, etc._: In this the third round of the Seventh
Circle are punished those guilty of sins of violence against God,
against nature, and against the arts by which alone a livelihood can
honestly be won. Those guilty as against God, the blasphemers, lie prone
like Capaneus (line 46), and are subject to the fiercest pain. Those
guilty of unnatural vice are stimulated into ceaseless motion, as
described in Cantos XV. and XVI. The usurers, those who despise honest
industry and the humanising arts of life, are found crouching on the
ground (_Inf._ xvii. 43).

[436] _The Alps_: Used here for mountains in general.

[437] _Such Alexander, etc._: The reference is to a pretended letter of
Alexander to Aristotle, in which he tells of the various hindrances met
with by his army from snow and rain and showers of fire. But in that
narrative it is the snow that is trampled down, while the flakes of fire
are caught by the soldiers upon their outspread cloaks. The story of the
shower of fire may have been suggested by Plutarch's mention of the
mineral oil in the province of Babylon, a strange thing to the Greeks;
and of how they were entertained by seeing the ground, which had been
sprinkled with it, burst into flame.

[438] _Eternal fire_: As always, the character of the place and of the
punishment bears a relation to the crimes of the inhabitants. They
sinned against nature in a special sense, and now they are confined to
the sterile sand where the only showers that fall are showers of fire.

[439] _The wretched hands_: The dance, named in the original the
_tresca_, was one in which the performers followed a leader and imitated
him in all his gestures, waving their hands as he did, up and down, and
from side to side. The simile is caught straight from common life.

[440] _At the gate_: Of the city of Dis (_Inf._ viii. 82).

[441] _Was slain, etc._: Capaneus, one of the Seven Kings, as told
below, when storming the walls of Thebes, taunted the other gods with
impunity, but his blasphemy against Jupiter was answered by a fatal
bolt.

[442] _Mongibello_: A popular name of Etna, under which mountain was
situated the smithy of Vulcan and the Cyclopes.

[443] _Phlegra_: Where the giants fought with the gods.

[444] _Fit ornament, etc._: Even if untouched by the pain he affects to
despise, he would yet suffer enough from the mad hatred of God that
rages in his breast. Capaneus is the nearest approach to the Satan of
Milton found in the _Inferno_. From the need of getting law enough by
which to try the heathen Dante is led into some inconsistency. After
condemning the virtuous heathen to Limbo for their ignorance of the one
true God, he now condemns the wicked heathen to this circle for
despising false gods. Jupiter here stands for, as need scarcely be said,
the Supreme Ruler; and in that sense he is termed God (line 69). But it
remains remarkable that the one instance of blasphemous defiance of God
should be taken from classical fable.

[445] _The forest fence_: They do not trust themselves so much as to
step upon the sand, but look out on it from the verge of the forest
which encircles it, and which as they travel they have on the left hand.

[446] _Bulicamë_: A hot sulphur spring a couple of miles from Viterbo,
greatly frequented for baths in the Middle Ages; and, it is said,
especially by light women. The water boils up into a large pool, whence
it flows by narrow channels; sometimes by one and sometimes by another,
as the purposes of the neighbouring peasants require. Sulphurous fumes
rise from the water as it runs. The incrustation of the bottom, sides,
and edges of those channels gives them the air of being solidly built.

[447] _The passage_: On each edge of the canal there is a flat pathway
of solid stone; and Dante sees that only by following one of these can a
passage be gained across the desert, for to set foot on the sand is
impossible for him owing to the falling flakes of fire. There may be
found in his description of the solid and flawless masonry of the canal
a trace of the pleasure taken in good building by the contemporaries of
Arnolfo. Nor is it without meaning that the sterile sands, the abode of
such as despised honest labour, is crossed by a perfect work of art
which they are forbidden ever to set foot upon.

[448] _The gateway_: At the entrance to Inferno.

[449] _Whose king_: Saturn, who ruled the world in the Golden Age. He,
as the devourer of his own offspring, is the symbol of Time; and the
image of Time is therefore set by Dante in the island where he reigned.

[450] _Her child_: Jupiter, hidden in the mountain from his father
Saturn.

[451] _Feed Acheron, etc._: The idea of this image is taken from the
figure in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel ii. But here, instead of the
Four Empires, the materials of the statue represent the Four Ages of the
world; the foot of clay on which it stands being the present time, which
is so bad that even iron were too good to represent it. Time turns his
back to the outworn civilisations of the East, and his face to Rome,
which, as the seat of the Empire and the Church, holds the secret of the
future. The tears of time shed by every Age save that of Gold feed the
four infernal streams and pools of Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and
Cocytus. Line 117 indicates that these are all fed by the same water;
are in fact different names for the same flood of tears. The reason why
Dante has not hitherto observed the connection between them is that he
has not made a complete circuit of each or indeed of any circle, as
Virgil reminds him at line 124, etc. The rivulet by which they stand
drains the boiling Phlegethon--where the water is all changed to blood,
because in it the murderers are punished--and flowing through the forest
of the suicides and the desert of the blasphemers, etc., tumbles into
the Eighth Circle as described in Canto xvi. 103. Cocytus they are
afterward to reach. An objection to this account of the infernal rivers
as being all fed by the same waters may be found in the difference of
volume of the great river of Acheron (_Inf._ iii. 71) and of this
brooklet. But this difference is perhaps to be explained by the
evaporation from the boiling waters of Phlegethon and of this stream
which drains it. Dante is almost the only poet applied to whom such
criticism would not be trifling. Another difficult point is how Cocytus
should not in time have filled, and more than filled, the Ninth Circle.

[452] _To the left hand_: Twice only as they descend they turn their
course to the right hand (_Inf._ ix. 132, and xvii. 31). The circuit of
the Inferno they do not complete till they reach the very base.

[453] _Lethe_: Found in the Earthly Paradise, as described in
_Purgatorio_ xxviii. 130.




CANTO XV.


  Now lies[454] our way along one of the margins hard;
    Steam rising from the rivulet forms a cloud,
    Which 'gainst the fire doth brook and borders guard.
  Like walls the Flemings, timorous of the flood
    Which towards them pours betwixt Bruges and Cadsand,[455]
    Have made, that ocean's charge may be withstood;
  Or what the Paduans on the Brenta's strand
    To guard their castles and their homesteads rear,
    Ere Chiarentana[456] feel the spring-tide bland;
  Of the same fashion did those dikes appear,                       10
    Though not so high[457] he made them, nor so vast,
    Whoe'er the builder was that piled them here.
  We, from the wood when we so far had passed
    I should not have distinguished where it lay
    Though I to see it backward glance had cast,
  A group of souls encountered on the way,
    Whose line of march was to the margin nigh.
    Each looked at us--as by the new moon's ray
  Men peer at others 'neath the darkening sky--
    Sharpening his brows on us and only us,                         20
    Like an old tailor on his needle's eye.
  And while that crowd was staring at me thus,
    One of them knew me, caught me by the gown,
    And cried aloud: 'Lo, this is marvellous!'[458]
  And straightway, while he thus to me held on,
    I fixed mine eyes upon his fire-baked face,
    And, spite of scorching, seemed his features known,
  And whose they were my memory well could trace;
    And I, with hand[459] stretched toward his face below,
    Asked: 'Ser Brunetto![460] and is this your place?'             30
  'O son,' he answered, 'no displeasure show,
    If now Brunetto Latini shall some way
    Step back with thee, and leave his troop to go.'
  I said: 'With all my heart for this I pray,
    And, if you choose, I by your side will sit;
    If he, for I go with him, grant delay.'
  'Son,' said he, 'who of us shall intermit
    Motion a moment, for an age must lie
    Nor fan himself when flames are round him lit.
  On, therefore! At thy skirts I follow nigh,                       40
    Then shall I overtake my band again,
    Who mourn a loss large as eternity.'
  I dared not from the path step to the plain
    To walk with him, but low I bent my head,[461]
    Like one whose steps are all with reverence ta'en.
  'What fortune or what destiny,' he said,
    'Hath brought thee here or e'er thou death hast seen;
    And who is this by whom thou'rt onward led?'
  'Up yonder,' said I, 'in the life serene,
    I in a valley wandered all forlorn                              50
    Before my years had full accomplished been.
  I turned my back on it but yestermorn;[462]
    Again I sought it when he came in sight
    Guided by whom[463] I homeward thus return.'
  And he to me: 'Following thy planet's light[464]
    Thou of a glorious haven canst not fail,
    If in the blithesome life I marked aright.
  And had my years known more abundant tale,
    Seeing the heavens so held thee in their grace
    I, heartening thee, had helped thee to prevail.                 60
  But that ungrateful and malignant race
    Which down from Fiesole[465] came long ago,
    And still its rocky origin betrays,
  Will for thy worthiness become thy foe;
    And with good reason, for 'mong crab-trees wild
    It ill befits the mellow fig to grow.
  By widespread ancient rumour are they styled
    A people blind, rapacious, envious, vain:
    See by their manners thou be not defiled.
  Fortune reserves such honour for thee, fain                       70
    Both sides[466] will be to enlist thee in their need;
    But from the beak the herb shall far remain.
  Let beasts of Fiesole go on to tread
    Themselves to litter, nor the plants molest,
    If any such now spring on their rank bed,
  In whom there flourishes indeed the blest
    Seed of the Romans who still lingered there
    When of such wickedness 'twas made the nest.'
  'Had I obtained full answer to my prayer,
    You had not yet been doomed,' I then did say,                   80
    'This exile from humanity to bear.
  For deep within my heart and memory
    Lives the paternal image good and dear
    Of you, as in the world, from day to day,
  How men escape oblivion you made clear;
    My thankfulness for which shall in my speech
    While I have life, as it behoves, appear.
  I note what of my future course you teach.
    Stored with another text[467] it will be glozed
    By one expert, should I that Lady reach.                        90
  Yet would I have this much to you disclosed:
    If but my conscience no reproaches yield,
    To all my fortune is my soul composed.
  Not new to me the hint by you revealed;
    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel apace,
    Even as she will; the clown[468] his mattock wield.'
  Thereon my Master right about[469] did face,
    And uttered this, with glance upon me thrown:
    'He hears[470] to purpose who doth mark the place.'
  And none the less I, speaking, still go on                       100
    With Ser Brunetto; asking him to tell
    Who of his band[471] are greatest and best known.
  And he to me: 'To hear of some is well,
    But of the rest 'tis fitting to be dumb,
    And time is lacking all their names to spell.
  That all of them were clerks, know thou in sum,
    All men of letters, famous and of might;
    Stained with one sin[472] all from the world are come.
  Priscian[473] goes with that crowd of evil plight,
    Francis d'Accorso[474] too; and hadst thou mind                110
    For suchlike trash thou mightest have had sight
  Of him the Slave[475] of Slaves to change assigned
    From Arno's banks to Bacchiglione, where
    His nerves fatigued with vice he left behind.
  More would I say, but neither must I fare
    Nor talk at further length, for from the sand
    I see new dust-clouds[476] rising in the air,
  I may not keep with such as are at hand.
    Care for my _Treasure_;[477] for I still survive
    In that my work. I nothing else demand.'                       120
  Then turned he back, and ran like those who strive
    For the Green Cloth[478] upon Verona's plain;
    And seemed like him that shall the first arrive,
  And not like him that labours all in vain.


FOOTNOTES:

[454] _Now lies, etc._: The stream on issuing from the wood flows right
across the waste of sand which that encompasses. To follow it they must
turn to the right, as always when, their general course being to the
left, they have to cross a Circle. But such a veering to the right is a
consequence of their leftward course, and not an exception to it.

[455] _Cadsand_: An island opposite to the mouth of the great canal of
Bruges.

[456] _Chiarentana_: What district or mountain is here meant has been
much disputed. It can be taken for Carinthia only on the supposition
that Dante was ignorant of where the Brenta rises. At the source of that
river stands the Monte Chiarentana, but it may be a question how old
that name is. The district name of it is Canzana, or Carenzana.

[457] _Not so high, etc._: This limitation is very characteristic of
Dante's style of thought, which compels him to a precision that will
produce the utmost possible effect of verisimilitude in his description.
Most poets would have made the walls far higher and more vast, by way of
lending grandeur to the conception.

[458] _Marvellous_: To find Dante, whom he knew, still living, and
passing through the Circle.

[459] _With hand, etc._: 'With my face bent to his' is another reading,
but there seems to be most authority for that in the text.--The fiery
shower forbids Dante to stoop over the edge of the causeway. To
Brunetto, who is some feet below him, he throws out his open hand, a
gesture of astonishment mingled with pity.

[460] _Ser Brunetto_: Brunetto Latini, a Florentine, was born in 1220.
As a notary he was entitled to be called Ser, or Messer. As appears from
the context, Dante was under great intellectual obligations to him, not,
we may suppose, as to a tutor so much as to an active-minded and
scholarly friend of mature age, and possessed of a ripe experience of
affairs. The social respect that Dante owed him is indicated by the use
of the plural form of address. See note, _Inf._ x. 51. Brunetto held
high appointments in the Republic. Perhaps with some exaggeration,
Villani says of him that he was the first to refine the Florentines,
teaching them to speak correctly, and to administer State affairs on
fixed principles of politics (_Cronica_, viii. 10). A Guelf in politics,
he shared in the exile of his party after the Ghibeline victory of
Montaperti in 1260, and for some years resided in Paris. There is reason
to suppose that he returned to Florence in 1269, and that he acted as
prothonotary of the court of Charles of Valois' vicar-general in
Tuscany. His signature as secretary to the Council of Florence is found
under the date of 1273. He died in 1294, when Dante was twenty-nine, and
was buried in the cloister of Santa Maria Maggiore, where his tombstone
may still be seen. (Not in Santa Maria Novella.) Villani mentions him in
his Chronicle with some reluctance, seeing he was a 'worldly man.' His
life must indeed have been vicious to the last, before Dante could have
had the heart to fix him in such company. Brunetto's chief works are the
_Tesoro_ and _Tesoretto_. For the _Tesoro_, see note at line 119. The
_Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, is an allegorical poem in Italian
rhymed couplets. In it he imagines himself, as he is on his return from
an embassy to Alphonso of Castile, meeting a scholar of Bologna of whom
he asks 'in smooth sweet words for news of Tuscany.' Having been told of
the catastrophe of Montaperti he wanders out of the beaten way into the
Forest of Roncesvalles, where he meets with various experiences; he is
helped by Ovid, is instructed by Ptolemy, and grows penitent for his
sins. In this, it will be seen, there is a general resemblance to the
action of the _Comedy_. There are even turns of expression that recall
Dante (_e.g._ beginning of _Cap._ iv.); but all together amounts to
little.

[461] _Low I bent my head_: But not projecting it beyond the line of
safety, strictly defined by the edge of the causeway. We are to imagine
to ourselves the fire of Sodom falling on Brunetto's upturned face, and
missing Dante's head only by an inch.

[462] _Yestermorn_: This is still the Saturday. It was Friday when Dante
met Virgil.

[463] _Guided by whom_: Brunetto has asked who the guide is, and Dante
does not tell him. A reason for the refusal has been ingeniously found
in the fact that among the numerous citations of the _Treasure_ Brunetto
seldom quotes Virgil. See also the charge brought against Guido
Cavalcanti (_Inf._ x. 63), of holding Virgil in disdain. But it is
explanation enough of Dante's omission to name his guide that he is
passing through Inferno to gain experience for himself, and not to
satisfy the curiosity of the shades he meets. See note on line 99.

[464] _Thy planet's light_: Some think that Brunetto had cast Dante's
horoscope. In a remarkable passage (_Parad._ xxii. 112) Dante attributes
any genius he may have to the influence of the Twins, which
constellation was in the ascendant when he was born. See also _Inf._
xxvi. 23. But here it is more likely that Brunetto refers to his
observation of Dante's good qualities, from which he gathered that he
was well starred.

[465] _Fiesole_: The mother city of Florence, to which also most of the
Fiesolans were believed to have migrated at the beginning of the
eleventh century. But all the Florentines did their best to establish a
Roman descent for themselves; and Dante among them. His fellow-citizens
he held to be for the most part of the boorish Fiesolan breed, rude and
stony-hearted as the mountain in whose cleft the cradle of their race
was seen from Florence.

[466] _Both sides_: This passage was most likely written not long after
Dante had ceased to entertain any hope of winning his way back to
Florence in the company of the Whites, whose exile he shared, and when
he was already standing in proud isolation from Black and White, from
Guelf and Ghibeline. There is nothing to show that his expectation of
being courted by both sides ever came true. Never a strong partisan, he
had, to use his own words, at last to make a party by himself, and stood
out an Imperialist with his heart set on the triumph of an Empire far
nobler than that the Ghibeline desired. Dante may have hoped to hold a
place of honour some day in the council of a righteous Emperor; and this
may be the glorious haven with the dream of which he was consoled in the
wanderings of his exile.

[467] _Another text_: Ciacco and Farinata have already hinted at the
troubles that lie ahead of him (_Inf._ vi. 65, and x. 79).

[468] _The clown, etc._: The honest performance of duty is the best
defence against adverse fortune.

[469] _Right about_: In traversing the sands they keep upon the
right-hand margin of the embanked stream, Virgil leading the way, with
Dante behind him on the right so that Brunetto may see and hear him
well.

[470] _He hears, etc._: Of all the interpretations of this somewhat
obscure sentence that seems the best which applies it to Virgil's
_Quicquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est_--'Whatever shall
happen, every fate is to be vanquished by endurance' (_Æn._ v. 710).
Taking this way of it, we have in the form of Dante's profession of
indifference to all the adverse fortune that may be in store for him a
refined compliment to his Guide; and in Virgil's gesture and words an
equally delicate revelation of himself to Brunetto, in which is conveyed
an answer to the question at line 48, 'Who is this that shows the
way?'--Otherwise, the words convey Virgil's approbation of Dante's
having so well attended to his advice to store Farinata's prophecy in
his memory (_Inf._ x.127).

[471] _His band_: That is, the company to which Brunetto specially
belongs, and from which for the time he has separated himself.

[472] _Stained with one sin_: Dante will not make Brunetto individually
confess his sin.

[473] _Priscian_: The great grammarian of the sixth century; placed here
without any reason, except that he is a representative teacher of youth.

[474] _Francis d'Accorso_: Died about 1294. The son of a great civil
lawyer, he was himself professor of the civil law at Bologna, where his
services were so highly prized that the Bolognese forbade him, on pain
of the confiscation of his goods, to accept an invitation from Edward I.
to go to Oxford.

[475] _Of him the Slave, etc._: One of the Pope's titles is _Servus
Servorum Domini_. The application of it to Boniface, so hated by Dante,
may be ironical: 'Fit servant of such a slave to vice!' The priest
referred to so contemptuously is Andrea, of the great Florentine family
of the Mozzi, who was much engaged in the political affairs of his time,
and became Bishop of Florence in 1286. About ten years later he was
translated to Vicenza, which stands on the Bacchiglione; and he died
shortly afterwards. According to Benvenuto he was a ridiculous preacher
and a man of dissolute manners. What is now most interesting about him
is that he was Dante's chief pastor during his early manhood, and is
consigned by him to the same disgraceful circle of Inferno as his
beloved master Brunetto Latini--a terrible evidence of the corruption of
life among the churchmen as well as the scholars of the thirteenth
century.

[476] _New dust-clouds_: Raised by a band by whom they are about to be
met.

[477] _My Treasure_: The _Trésor_, or _Tesoro_, Brunetto's principal
work, was written by him in French as being 'the pleasantest language,
and the most widely spread.' In it he treats of things in general in the
encyclopedic fashion set him by Alphonso of Castile. The first half
consists of a summary of civil and natural history. The second is
devoted to ethics, rhetoric, and politics. To a great extent it is a
compilation, containing, for instance, a translation, nearly complete,
of the Ethics of Aristotle--not, of course, direct from the Greek. It is
written in a plodding style, and speaks to more industry than genius. To
it Dante is indebted for some facts and fables.

[478] _The Green Cloth_: To commemorate a victory won by the Veronese
there was instituted a race to be run on the first Sunday of Lent. The
prize was a piece of green cloth. The competitors ran naked.--Brunetto
does not disappear into the gloom without a parting word of applause
from his old pupil. Dante's rigorous sentence on his beloved master is
pronounced as softly as it can be. We must still wonder that he has the
heart to bring him to such an awful judgment.




CANTO XVI.


  Now could I hear the water as it fell
    To the next circle[479] with a murmuring sound
    Like what is heard from swarming hives to swell;
  When three shades all together with a bound
    Burst from a troop met by us pressing on
    'Neath rain of that sharp torment. O'er the ground
  Toward us approaching, they exclaimed each one:
    'Halt thou, whom from thy garb[480] we judge to be
    A citizen of our corrupted town.'
  Alas, what scars I on their limbs did see,                        10
    Both old and recent, which the flames had made:
    Even now my ruth is fed by memory.
  My Teacher halted at their cry, and said:
    'Await a while:' and looked me in the face;
    'Some courtesy to these were well displayed.
  And but that fire--the manner of the place--
    Descends for ever, fitting 'twere to find
    Rather than them, thee quickening thy pace.'
  When we had halted, they again combined
    In their old song; and, reaching where we stood,                20
    Into a wheel all three were intertwined.
  And as the athletes used, well oiled and nude,
    To feel their grip and, wary, watch their chance,
    Ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could;
  So each of them kept fixed on me his glance
    As he wheeled round,[481] and in opposing ways
    His neck and feet seemed ever to advance.
  'Ah, if the misery of this sand-strewn place
    Bring us and our petitions in despite,'
    One then began, 'and flayed and grimy face;                     30
  Let at the least our fame goodwill incite
    To tell us who thou art, whose living feet
    Thus through Inferno wander without fright.
  For he whose footprints, as thou see'st, I beat,
    Though now he goes with body peeled and nude,
    More than thou thinkest, in the world was great.
  The grandson was he of Gualdrada good;
    He, Guidoguerra,[482] with his armèd hand
    Did mighty things, and by his counsel shrewd.
  The other who behind me treads the sand                           40
    Is one whose name should on the earth be dear;
    For he is Tegghiaio[483] Aldobrand.
  And I, who am tormented with them here,
    James Rusticucci[484] was; my fierce and proud
    Wife of my ruin was chief minister.'
  If from the fire there had been any shroud
    I should have leaped down 'mong them, nor have earned
    Blame, for my Teacher sure had this allowed.
  But since I should have been all baked and burned,
    Terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain                       50
    With which to clasp them in my arms I yearned.
  Then I began: ''Twas not contempt but pain
    Which your condition in my breast awoke,
    Where deeply rooted it will long remain,
  When this my Master words unto me spoke,
    By which expectancy was in me stirred
    That ye who came were honourable folk.
  I of your city[485] am, and with my word
    Your deeds and honoured names oft to recall
    Delighted, and with joy of them I heard.                        60
  To the sweet fruits I go, and leave the gall,
    As promised to me by my Escort true;
    But first I to the centre down must fall.'
  'So may thy soul thy members long endue
    With vital power,' the other made reply,
    'And after thee thy fame[486] its light renew;
  As thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy
    Within our city as of yore remain,
    Or from it have been wholly forced to fly.
  For William Borsier,[487] one of yonder train,                    70
    And but of late joined with us in this woe,
    Causeth us with his words exceeding pain.'
  'Upstarts, and fortunes suddenly that grow,
    Have bred in thee pride and extravagance,[488]
    Whence tears, O Florence! thou art shedding now.'
  Thus cried I with uplifted countenance.
    The three, accepting it for a reply,
    Glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance.
  And all: 'If others thou shalt satisfy
    As well at other times[489] at no more cost,                    80
    Happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry!
  Therefore if thou escap'st these regions lost,
    Returning to behold the starlight fair,
    Then when "There was I,"[490] thou shalt make thy boast,
  Something of us do thou 'mong men declare.'
    Then broken was the wheel, and as they fled
    Their nimble legs like pinions beat the air.
  So much as one _Amen!_ had scarce been said
    Quicker than what they vanished from our view.
    On this once more the way my Master led.                        90
  I followed, and ere long so near we drew
    To where the water fell, that for its roar
    Speech scarcely had been heard between us two.
  And as the stream which of all those which pour
    East (from Mount Viso counting) by its own
    Course falls the first from Apennine to shore--
  As Acquacheta[491] in the uplands known
    By name, ere plunging to its bed profound;
    Name lost ere by Forlì its waters run--
  Above St. Benedict with one long bound,                          100
    Where for a thousand[492] would be ample room,
    Falls from the mountain to the lower ground;
  Down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom
    We found to fall echoing from side to side,
    Stunning the ear with its tremendous boom.
  There was a cord about my middle tied,
    With which I once had thought that I might hold
    Secure the leopard with the painted hide.
  When this from round me I had quite unrolled
    To him I handed it, all coiled and tight;                      110
    As by my Leader I had first been told.
  Himself then bending somewhat toward the right,[493]
    He just beyond the edge of the abyss
    Threw down the cord,[494] which disappeared from sight.
  'That some strange thing will follow upon this
    Unwonted signal which my Master's eye
    Thus follows,' so I thought, 'can hardly miss.'
  Ah, what great caution need we standing by
    Those who behold not only what is done,
    But who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy!                   120
  He said to me: 'There shall emerge, and soon,
    What I await; and quickly to thy view
    That which thou dream'st of shall be clearly known.'[495]
  From utterance of truth which seems untrue
    A man, whene'er he can, should guard his tongue;
    Lest he win blame to no transgression due.
  Yet now I must speak out, and by the song
    Of this my Comedy, Reader, I swear--
    So in good liking may it last full long!--
  I saw a shape swim upward through that air.                      130
    All indistinct with gross obscurity,
    Enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear:
  Like one who rises having dived to free
    An anchor grappled on a jagged stone,
    Or something else deep hidden in the sea;
  With feet drawn in and arms all open thrown.


FOOTNOTES:

[479] _The next circle_: The Eighth.

[480] _Thy garb_: 'Almost every city,' says Boccaccio, 'had in those
times its peculiar fashion of dress distinct from that of neighboring
cities.'

[481] _As he wheeled round_: Virgil and Dante have come to a halt upon
the embankment. The three shades, to whom it is forbidden to be at rest
for a moment, clasping one another as in a dance, keep wheeling round in
circle upon the sand.

[482] _Guidoguerra_: A descendant of the Counts Guidi of Modigliana.
Gualdrada was the daughter of Bellincion Berti de' Ravignani, praised
for his simple habits in the _Paradiso_, xv. 112. Guidoguerra was a
Guelf leader, and after the defeat of Montaperti acted as Captain of his
party, in this capacity lending valuable aid to Charles of Anjou at the
battle of Benevento, 1266, when Manfred was overthrown. He had no
children, and left the Commonwealth of Florence his heir.

[483] _Tegghiaio_: Son of Aldobrando of the Adimari. His name should be
dear in Florence, because he did all he could to dissuade the citizens
from the campaign which ended so disastrously at Montaperti.

[484] _James Rusticucci_: An accomplished cavalier of humble birth, said
to have been a retainer of Dante's friends the Cavalcanti. The
commentators have little to tell of him except that he made an unhappy
marriage, which is evident from the text. Of the sins of him and his
companions there is nothing known beyond what is to be inferred from the
poet's words, and nothing to say, except that when Dante consigned men
of their stamp, frank and amiable, to the Infernal Circles, we may be
sure that he only executed a verdict already accepted as just by the
whole of Florence. And when we find him impartially damning Guelf and
Ghibeline we may be equally sure that he looked for the aid of neither
party, and of no family however powerful in the State, to bring his
banishment to a close. He would even seem to be careful to stop any hole
by which he might creep back to Florence. When he did return, it was to
be in the train of the Emperor, so he hoped, and as one who gives rather
than seeks forgiveness.

[485] _Of your city, etc._: At line 32 Rusticucci begs Dante to tell who
he is. He tells that he is of their city, which they have already
gathered from his _berretta_ and the fashion of his gown; but he tells
nothing, almost, of himself. Unless to Farinata, indeed, he never makes
an open breast to any one met in Inferno. But here he does all that
courtesy requires.

[486] _Thy fame_: Dante has implied in his answer that he is gifted with
oratorical powers and is the object of a special Divine care; and the
illustrious Florentine, frankly acknowledging the claim he makes,
adjures him by the fame which is his in store to appease an eager
curiosity about the Florence which even in Inferno is the first thought
of every not ignoble Florentine.

[487] _William Borsiere_: A Florentine, witty and well bred, according
to Boccaccio. Being once at Genoa he was shown a fine new palace by its
miserly owner, and was asked to suggest a subject for a painting with
which to adorn the hall. The subject was to be something that nobody had
ever seen. Borsiere proposed liberality as something that the miser at
any rate had never yet got a good sight of; an answer of which it is not
easy to detect either the wit or the courtesy, but which is said to have
converted the churl to liberal ways (_Decam._ i. 8). He is here
introduced as an authority on the noble style of manners.

[488] _Pride and extravagance_: In place of the nobility of mind that
leads to great actions, and the gentle manners that prevail in a society
where there is a due subordination of rank to rank and well-defined
duties for every man. This, the aristocratic in a noble sense, was
Dante's ideal of a social state; for all his instincts were those of a
Florentine aristocrat, corrected though they were by his good sense and
his thirst for a reign of perfect justice. During his own time he had
seen Florence grow more and more democratic; and he was
irritated--unreasonably, considering that it was only a sign of the
general prosperity--at the spectacle of the amazing growth of wealth in
the hands of low-born traders, who every year were coming more to the
front and monopolising influence at home and abroad at the cost of their
neighbours and rivals with longer pedigrees and shorter purses. In
_Paradiso_ xvi. Dante dwells at length on the degeneracy of the
Florentines.

[489] _At other times_: It is hinted that his outspokenness will not in
the future always give equal satisfaction to those who hear.

[490] _There was I, etc._: _Forsan et hæc olim meminisse
juvabit._--_Æn._ i. 203.

[491] _Acquacheta_: The fall of the water of the brook over the lofty
cliff that sinks from the Seventh to the Eighth Circle is compared to
the waterfall upon the Montone at the monastery of St. Benedict, in the
mountains above Forlì. The Po rises in Monte Viso. Dante here travels in
imagination from Monte Viso down through Italy, and finds that all the
rivers which rise on the left hand, that is, on the north-east of the
Apennine, fall into the Po, till the Montone is reached, that river
falling into the Adriatic by a course of its own. Above Forlì it was
called Acquacheta. The Lamone, north of the Montone, now follows an
independent course to the sea, having cut a new bed for itself since
Dante's time.

[492] _Where for a thousand, etc._: In the monastery there was room for
many more monks, say most of the commentators; or something to the like
effect. Mr. Longfellow's interpretation seems better: Where the height
of the fall is so great that it would divide into a thousand falls.

[493] _Toward the right_: The attitude of one about to throw.

[494] _The cord_: The services of Geryon are wanted to convey them down
the next reach of the pit; and as no voice could be heard for the noise
of the waterfall, and no signal be made to catch the eye amid the gloom,
Virgil is obliged to call the attention of the monster by casting some
object into the depth where he lies concealed. But, since they are
surrounded by solid masonry and slack sand, one or other of them must
supply something fit to throw down; and the cord worn by Dante is fixed
on as what can best be done without. There may be a reference to the
cord of Saint Francis, which Dante, according to one of his
commentators, wore when he was a young man, following in this a fashion
common enough among pious laymen who had no thought of ever becoming
friars. But the simile of the cord, as representing sobriety and
virtuous purpose, is not strange to Dante. In _Purg._ vii. 114 he
describes Pedro of Arragon as being girt with the cord of every virtue;
and Pedro was no Franciscan. Dante's cord may therefore be taken as
standing for vigilance or self-control. With it he had hoped to get the
better of the leopard (_Inf._ i. 32), and may have trusted in it for
support as against the terrors of Inferno. But although he has been girt
with it ever since he entered by the gate, it has not saved him from a
single fear, far less from a single danger; and now it is cast away as
useless. Henceforth, more than ever, he is to confide wholly in Virgil
and have no confidence in himself. Nor is he to be girt again till he
reaches the coast of Purgatory, and then it is to be with a reed, the
emblem of humility.--But, however explained, the incident will always be
somewhat of a puzzle.

[495] Dante attributes to Virgil full knowledge of all that is in his
own mind. He thus heightens our conception of his dependence on his
guide, with whose will his will is blent, and whose thoughts are always
found to be anticipating his own. Few readers will care to be constantly
recalling to mind that Virgil represents enlightened human reason. But
even if we confine ourselves to the easiest sense of the narrative, the
study of the relations between him and Dante will be found one of the
most interesting suggested by the poem--perhaps only less so than that
of Dante's moods of wonder, anger, and pity.




CANTO XVII.


  'Behold the monster[496] with the pointed tail,
    Who passes mountains[497] and can entrance make
    Through arms and walls! who makes the whole world ail,
  Corrupted by him!' Thus my Leader spake,
    And beckoned him that he should land hard by,
    Where short the pathways built of marble break.
  And that foul image of dishonesty
    Moving approached us with his head and chest,
    But to the bank[498] drew not his tail on high.
  His face a human righteousness expressed,                         10
    'Twas so benignant to the outward view;
    A serpent was he as to all the rest.
  On both his arms hair to the arm-pits grew:
    On back and chest and either flank were knot[499]
    And rounded shield portrayed in various hue;
  No Turk or Tartar weaver ever brought
    To ground or pattern a more varied dye;[500]
    Nor by Arachne[501] was such broidery wrought.
  As sometimes by the shore the barges lie
    Partly in water, partly on dry land;                            20
    And as afar in gluttonous Germany,[502]
  Watching their prey, alert the beavers stand;
    So did this worst of brutes his foreparts fling
    Upon the stony rim which hems the sand.
  All of his tail in space was quivering,
    Its poisoned fork erecting in the air,
    Which scorpion-like was armèd with a sting.
  My Leader said: 'Now we aside must fare
    A little distance, so shall we attain
    Unto the beast malignant crouching there.'                      30
  So we stepped down upon the right,[503] and then
    A half score steps[504] to the outer edge did pace,
    Thus clearing well the sand and fiery rain.
  And when we were hard by him I could trace
    Upon the sand a little further on
    Some people sitting near to the abyss.
  'That what this belt containeth may be known
    Completely by thee,' then the Master said;
    'To see their case do thou advance alone.
  Let thy inquiries be succinctly made.                             40
    While thou art absent I will ask of him,
    With his strong shoulders to afford us aid.'
  Then, all alone, I on the outmost rim
    Of that Seventh Circle still advancing trod,
    Where sat a woful folk.[505] Full to the brim
  Their eyes with anguish were, and overflowed;
    Their hands moved here and there to win some ease,
    Now from the flames, now from the soil which glowed.
  No otherwise in summer-time one sees,
    Working its muzzle and its paws, the hound                      50
    When bit by gnats or plagued with flies or fleas.
  And I, on scanning some who sat around
    Of those on whom the dolorous flames alight,
    Could recognise[506] not one. I only found
  A purse hung from the throat of every wight,
    Each with its emblem and its special hue;
    And every eye seemed feasting on the sight.
  As I, beholding them, among them drew,
    I saw what seemed a lion's face and mien
    Upon a yellow purse designed in blue.                           60
  Still moving on mine eyes athwart the scene
    I saw another scrip, blood-red, display
    A goose more white than butter could have been.
  And one, on whose white wallet blazoned lay
    A pregnant sow[507] in azure, to me said:
    'What dost thou in this pit? Do thou straightway
  Begone; and, seeing thou art not yet dead,
    Know that Vitalian,[508] neighbour once of mine,
    Shall on my left flank one day find his bed.
  A Paduan I: all these are Florentine;                             70
    And oft they stun me, bellowing in my ear:
    "Come, Pink of Chivalry,[509] for whom we pine,
  Whose is the purse on which three beaks appear:"'
    Then he from mouth awry his tongue thrust out[510]
    Like ox that licks its nose; and I, in fear
  Lest more delay should stir in him some doubt
    Who gave command I should not linger long,
    Me from those wearied spirits turned about.
  I found my Guide, who had already sprung
    Upon the back of that fierce animal:                            80
    He said to me: 'Now be thou brave and strong.
  By stairs like this[511] we henceforth down must fall.
    Mount thou in front, for I between would sit
    So thee the tail shall harm not nor appal.'
  Like one so close upon the shivering fit
    Of quartan ague that his nails grow blue,
    And seeing shade he trembles every whit,
  I at the hearing of that order grew;
    But his threats shamed me, as before the face
    Of a brave lord his man grows valorous too.                     90
  On the great shoulders then I took my place,
    And wished to say, but could not move my tongue
    As I expected: 'Do thou me embrace!'
  But he, who other times had helped me 'mong
    My other perils, when ascent I made
    Sustained me, and strong arms around me flung,
  And, 'Geryon, set thee now in motion!' said;
    'Wheel widely; let thy downward flight be slow;
    Think of the novel burden on thee laid.'
  As from the shore a boat begins to go                            100
    Backward at first, so now he backward pressed,
    And when he found that all was clear below,
  He turned his tail where earlier was his breast;
    And, stretching it, he moved it like an eel,
    While with his paws he drew air toward his chest.
  More terror Phaëthon could hardly feel
    What time he let the reins abandoned fall,
    Whence Heaven was fired,[512] as still its tracts reveal;
  Nor wretched Icarus, on finding all
    His plumage moulting as the wax grew hot,                      110
    While, 'The wrong road!' his father loud did call;
  Than what I felt on finding I was brought
    Where nothing was but air and emptiness;
    For save the brute I could distinguish nought.
  He slowly, slowly swims; to the abyss
    Wheeling he makes descent, as I surmise
    From wind felt 'neath my feet and in my face.
  Already on the right I heard arise
    From out the caldron a terrific roar,[513]
    Whereon I stretch my head with down-turned eyes.               120
  Terror of falling now oppressed me sore;
    Hearing laments, and seeing fires that burned,
    My thighs I tightened, trembling more and more.
  Earlier I had not by the eye discerned
    That we swept downward; scenes of torment now
    Seemed drawing nearer wheresoe'er we turned.
  And as a falcon (which long time doth go
    Upon the wing, not finding lure[514] or prey),
    While 'Ha!' the falconer cries, 'descending so!'
  Comes wearied back whence swift it soared away;                  130
    Wheeling a hundred times upon the road,
    Then, from its master far, sulks angrily:
  So we, by Geryon in the deep bestowed,
    Were 'neath the sheer-hewn precipice set down:
    He, suddenly delivered from our load,
  Like arrow from the string was swiftly gone.


FOOTNOTES:

[496] _The monster_: Geryon, a mythical king of Spain, converted here
into the symbol of fraud, and set as the guardian demon of the Eighth
Circle, where the fraudulent are punished. There is nothing in the
mythology to justify this account of Geryon; and it seems that Dante has
created a monster to serve his purpose. Boccaccio, in his _Genealogy of
the Gods_ (Lib. i.), repeats the description of Geryon given by 'Dante
the Florentine, in his poem written in the Florentine tongue, one
certainly of no little importance among poems;' and adds that Geryon
reigned in the Balearic Isles, and was used to decoy travellers with his
benignant countenance, caressing words, and every kind of friendly lure,
and then to murder them when asleep.

[497] _Who passes mountains, etc._: Neither art nor nature affords any
defence against fraud.

[498] _The bank_: Not that which confines the brook but the inner limit
of the Seventh Circle, from which the precipice sinks sheer into the
Eighth, and to which the embankment by which the travellers have crossed
the sand joins itself on. Virgil has beckoned Geryon to come to that
part of the bank which adjoins the end of the causeway.

[499] _Knot and rounded shield_: Emblems of subtle devices and
subterfuges.

[500]_ Varied dye_: Denoting the various colours of deceit.

[501] _Arachne_: The Lydian weaver changed into a spider by Minerva. See
_Purg._ xii. 43.

[502] _Gluttonous Germany_: The habits of the German men-at-arms in
Italy, odious to the temperate Italians, explains this gibe.

[503] _The right_: This is the second and last time that, in their
course through Inferno, they turn to the right. See _Inf._ ix. 132. The
action may possibly have a symbolical meaning, and refer to the
protection against fraud which is obtained by keeping to a righteous
course. But here, in fact, they have no choice, for, traversing the
Inferno as they do to the left hand, they came to the right bank of the
stream which traverses the fiery sands, followed it, and now, when they
would leave its edge, it is from the right embankment that they have to
step down, and necessarily to the right hand.

[504] _A half score steps, etc._: Traversing the stone-built border
which lies between the sand and the precipice. Had the brook flowed to
the very edge of the Seventh Circle before tumbling down the rocky wall
it is clear that they might have kept to the embankment until they were
clear beyond the edge of the sand. We are therefore to figure to
ourselves the water as plunging down at a point some yards, perhaps the
width of the border, short of the true limit of the circle; and this is
a touch of local truth, since waterfalls in time always wear out a
funnel for themselves by eating back the precipice down which they
tumble. It was into this funnel that Virgil flung the cord, and up it
that Geryon was seen to ascend, as if by following up the course of the
water he would find out who had made the signal. To keep to the narrow
causeway where it ran on by the edge of this gulf would seem too full of
risk.

[505] _Woful folk_: Usurers; those guilty of the unnatural sin of
contemning the legitimate modes of human industry. They sit huddled up
on the sand, close to its bound of solid masonry, from which Dante looks
down on them. But that the usurers are not found only at the edge of the
plain is evident from _Inf._ xiv. 19.

[506] _Could recognise, etc._: Though most of the group prove to be from
Florence Dante recognises none of them; and this denotes that nothing so
surely creates a second nature in a man, in a bad sense, as setting the
heart on money. So in the Fourth Circle those who, being unable to spend
moderately, are always thinking of how to keep or get money are
represented as 'obscured from any recognition' (_Inf._ vii. 44).

[507] _A pregnant sow_: The azure lion on a golden field was the arms of
the Gianfigliazzi, eminent usurers of Florence; the white goose on a red
ground was the arms of the Ubriachi of Florence; the azure sow, of the
Scrovegni of Padua.

[508] _Vitalian_: A rich Paduan noble, whose palace was near that of the
Scrovegni.

[509] _Pink of Chivalry_: 'Sovereign Cavalier;' identified by his arms
as Ser Giovanni Buiamonte, still alive in Florence in 1301, and if we
are to judge from the text, the greatest usurer of all. A northern poet
of the time would have sought his usurers in the Jewry of some town he
knew, but Dante finds his among the nobles of Padua and Florence. He
ironically represents them as wearing purses ornamented with their coats
of arms, perhaps to hint that they pursued their dishonourable trade
under shelter of their noble names--their shop signs, as it were. The
whole passage may have been planned by Dante so as to afford him the
opportunity of damning the still living Buiamonte without mentioning his
name.

[510] _His tongue thrust out_: As if to say: We know well what sort of
fine gentleman Buiamonte is.

[511] _By stairs like this_: The descent from one circle to another
grows more difficult the further down they come. They appear to have
found no special obstacle in the nature of the ground till they reached
the bank sloping down to the Fifth Circle, the pathway down which is
described as terrible (_Inf._ vii. 105). The descent into the Seventh
Circle is made practicable, and nothing more (_Inf._ xii. I).

[512] _Heaven was fired_: As still appears in the Milky Way. In the
_Convito_, ii. 15, Dante discusses the various explanations of what
causes the brightness of that part of the heavens.

[513] _A terrific roar_: Of the water falling to the ground. On
beginning the descent they had left the waterfall on the left hand, but
Geryon, after fetching one or more great circles, passes in front of it,
and then they have it on the right. There is no further mention of the
waters of Phlegethon till they are found frozen in Cocytus (_Inf._
xxxii. 23). Philalethes suggests that they flow under the Eighth Circle.

[514] _Lure_: An imitation bird used in training falcons. Dante
describes the sulky, slow descent of a falcon which has either lost
sight of its prey, or has failed to discover where the falconer has
thrown the lure. Geryon has descended thus deliberately owing to the
command of Virgil.




CANTO XVIII.


  Of iron colour, and composed of stone,
    A place called Malebolge[515] is in Hell,
    Girt by a cliff of substance like its own.
  In that malignant region yawns a well[516]
    Right in the centre, ample and profound;
    Of which I duly will the structure tell.
  The zone[517] that lies between them, then, is round--
    Between the well and precipice hard and high;
    Into ten vales divided is the ground.
  As is the figure offered to the eye,                              10
    Where numerous moats a castle's towers enclose
    That they the walls may better fortify;
  A like appearance was made here by those.
    And as, again, from threshold of such place
    Many a drawbridge to the outworks goes;
  So ridges from the precipice's base
    Cutting athwart the moats and barriers run,
    Till at the well join the extremities.[518]
  From Geryon's back when we were shaken down
    'Twas here we stood, until the Poet's feet                      20
    Moved to the left, and I, behind, came on.
  New torments on the right mine eyes did meet
    With new tormentors, novel woe on woe;
    With which the nearer Bolgia was replete.
  Sinners, all naked, in the gulf below,
    This side the middle met us; while they strode
    On that side with us, but more swift did go.[519]
  Even so the Romans, that the mighty crowd
    Across the bridge, the year of Jubilee,
    Might pass with ease, ordained a rule of road[520]--            30
  Facing the Castle, on that side should be
    The multitude which to St. Peter's hied;
    So to the Mount on this was passage free.
  On the grim rocky ground, on either side,
    I saw horned devils[521] armed with heavy whip
    Which on the sinners from behind they plied.
  Ah, how they made the wretches nimbly skip
    At the first lashes; no one ever yet
    But sought from the second and the third to slip.
  And as I onward went, mine eyes were set                          40
    On one of them; whereon I called in haste:
    'This one already I have surely met!'
  Therefore to know him, fixedly I gazed;
    And my kind Leader willingly delayed,
    While for a little I my course retraced.
  On this the scourged one, thinking to evade
    My search, his visage bent without avail,
    For: 'Thou that gazest on the ground,' I said,
  'If these thy features tell trustworthy tale,
    Venedico Caccianimico[522] thou!                                50
    But what has brought thee to such sharp regale?'[523]
  And he, 'I tell it 'gainst my will, I trow,
    But thy clear accents[524] to the old world bear
    My memory, and make me all avow.
  I was the man who Ghisola the fair
    To serve the Marquis' evil will led on,
    Whatever[525] the uncomely tale declare.
  Of Bolognese here weeping not alone
    Am I; so full the place of them, to-day
    'Tween Reno and Savena[526] are not known                       60
  So many tongues that _Sipa_ deftly say:
    And if of this thou'dst know the reason why,
    Think but how greedy were our hearts alway.'
  To him thus speaking did a demon cry:
    'Pander, begone!' and smote him with his thong;
    'Here are no women for thy coin to buy.'
  Then, with my Escort joined, I moved along.
    Few steps we made until we there had come,
    Where from the bank a rib of rock was flung.
  With ease enough up to its top we clomb,                          70
    And, turning on the ridge, bore to the right;[527]
    And those eternal circles[528] parted from.
  When we had reached where underneath the height
    A passage opes, yielding the scourged a way,
    My Guide bade: 'Tarry, so to hold in sight
  Those other spirits born in evil day,
    Whose faces until now from thee have been
    Concealed, because with ours their progress lay.'
  Then from the ancient bridge by us were seen
    The troop which toward us on that circuit sped,                 80
    Chased onward, likewise, by the scourges keen.
  And my good Master, ere I asked him, said:
    'That lordly one now coming hither, see,
    By whom, despite of pain, no tears are shed.
  What mien he still retains of majesty!
    'Tis Jason, who by courage and by guile
    The Colchians of the ram deprived. 'Twas he
  Who on his passage by the Lemnian isle,
    Where all of womankind with daring hand
    Upon their males had wrought a murder vile,                     90
  With loving pledges and with speeches bland
    The tender-yeared Hypsipyle betrayed,
    Who had herself a fraud on others planned.
  Forlorn he left her then, when pregnant made.
    That is the crime condemns him to this pain;
    And for Medea[529] too is vengeance paid.
  Who in his manner cheat compose his train.
    Of the first moat sufficient now is known,
    And those who in its jaws engulfed remain.'
  Already had we by the strait path gone                           100
    To where 'tis with the second bank dovetailed--
    The buttress whence a second arch is thrown.
  Here heard we who in the next Bolgia wailed[530]
    And puffed for breath; reverberations told
    They with their open palms themselves assailed.
  The sides were crusted over with a mould
    Plastered upon them by foul mists that rise,
    And both with eyes and nose a contest hold.
  The bottom is so deep, in vain our eyes
    Searched it till further up the bridge we went,                110
    To where the arch o'erhangs what under lies.
  Ascended there, our eyes we downward bent,
    And I saw people in such ordure drowned,
    A very cesspool 'twas of excrement.
  And while I from above am searching round,
    One with a head so filth-smeared I picked out,
    I knew not if 'twas lay, or tonsure-crowned.
  'Why then so eager,' asked he with a shout,
    'To stare at me of all the filthy crew?'
    And I to him: 'Because I scarce can doubt                      120
  That formerly thee dry of hair I knew,
    Alessio Interminei[531] the Lucchese;
    And therefore thee I chiefly hold in view.'
  Smiting his head-piece, then, his words were these:
    ''Twas flattery steeped me here; for, using such,
    My tongue itself enough could never please.'
  'Now stretch thou somewhat forward, but not much,'
    Thereon my Leader bade me, 'and thine eyes
    Slowly advance till they her features touch
  And the dishevelled baggage recognise,                           130
    Clawing her yonder with her nails unclean,
    Now standing up, now squatting on her thighs.
  'Tis harlot Thais,[532] who, when she had been
    Asked by her lover, "Am I generous
    And worthy thanks?" said, "Greatly so, I ween."
  Enough[533] of this place has been seen by us.'


FOOTNOTES:

[515] _Malebolge_: Or Evil Pits; literally, Evil Pockets.

[516] _A well_: The Ninth and lowest Circle, to be described in Canto
xxxii., etc.

[517] _The zone_: The Eighth Circle, in which the fraudulent of all
species are punished, lies between the precipice and the Ninth Circle. A
vivid picture of the enormous height of the enclosing wall has been
presented to us at the close of the preceding Canto. As in the
description of the Second Circle the atmosphere is represented as
malignant, being murky and disturbed with tempest; so the Malebolge is
called malignant too, being all of barren iron-coloured rock. In both
cases the surroundings of the sinners may well be spoken of as malign,
adverse to any thought of goodwill and joy.

[518] _The extremities_: The _Malebolge_ consists of ten circular pits
or fosses, one inside of another. The outermost lies under the precipice
which falls sheer from the Seventh Circle; the innermost, and of course
the smallest, runs immediately outside of the 'Well,' which is the Ninth
Circle. The Bolgias or valleys are divided from each other by rocky
banks; and, each Bolgia being at a lower level than the one that
encloses it, the inside of each bank is necessarily deeper than the
outside. Ribs or ridges of rock--like spokes of a wheel to the
axle-tree--run from the foot of the precipice to the outer rim of the
'Well,' vaulting the moats at right angles with the course of them. Thus
each rib takes the form of a ten-arched bridge. By one or other of these
Virgil and Dante now travel towards the centre and the base of Inferno;
their general course being downward, though varied by the ascent in turn
of the hog-backed arches over the moats.

[519] _More swift_: The sinners in the First Bolgia are divided into two
gangs, moving in opposite directions, the course of those on the outside
being to the right, as looked at by Dante. These are the shades of
panders; those in the inner current are such as seduced on their own
account. Here a list of the various classes of sinners contained in the
Bolgias of the Eighth Circle may be given:--

  1st  Bolgia--Seducers,                   CANTO XVIII.
  2d     "     Flatterers,                   "     "
  3d     "     Simoniacs,                    "   XIX.
  4th    "     Soothsayers,                  "   XX.
  5th    "     Barrators,                    "   XXI. XXII.
  6th    "     Hypocrites,                   "   XXIII.
  7th    "     Thieves,                      "   XXIV. XXV.
  8th    "     Evil Counsellors,             "   XXVI. XXVII.
  9th    "     Scandal and Heresy Mongers,   "   XXVIII. XXIX.
  10th   "     Falsifiers,                   "   XXIX. XXX.

[520] _A rule of road_: In the year 1300 a Jubilee was held in Rome with
Plenary Indulgence for all pilgrims. Villani says that while it lasted
the number of strangers in Rome was never less than two hundred
thousand. The bridge and castle spoken of in the text are those of St.
Angelo. The Mount is probably the Janiculum.

[521] _Horned devils_: Here the demons are horned--terrible
remembrancers to the sinner of the injured husband.

[522] _Venedico Caccianimico_: A Bolognese noble, brother of Ghisola,
whom he inveigled into yielding herself to the Marquis of Este, lord of
Ferrara. Venedico died between 1290 and 1300.

[523] _Such sharp regale_: 'Such pungent sauces.' There is here a play
of words on the _Salse_, the name of a wild ravine outside the walls of
Bologna, where the bodies of felons were thrown. Benvenuto says it used
to be a taunt among boys at Bologna: Your father was pitched into the
Salse.

[524] _Thy clear accents_: Not broken with sobs like his own and those
of his companions.

[525] _Whatever, etc._: Different accounts seem to have been current
about the affair of Ghisola.

[526] _'Tween Reno, etc._: The Reno and Savena are streams that flow
past Bologna. _Sipa_ is Bolognese for Maybe, or for Yes. So Dante
describes Tuscany as the country where _Si_ is heard (_Inf._ xxxiii.
80). With regard to the vices of the Bolognese, Benvenuto says: 'Dante
had studied in Bologna, and had seen and observed all these things.'

[527] _To the right_: This is only an apparent departure from their
leftward course. Moving as they were to the left along the edge of the
Bolgia, they required to turn to the right to cross the bridge that
spanned it.

[528] _Those eternal circles_: The meaning is not clear; perhaps it only
is that they have now done with the outer stream of sinners in this
Bolgia, left by them engaged in endless procession round and round.

[529] _Medea_: When the Argonauts landed on Lemnos, they found it
without any males, the women, incited by Venus, having put them all to
death, with the exception of Thoas, saved by his daughter Hypsipyle.
When Jason deserted her he sailed for Colchis, and with the assistance
of Medea won the Golden Fleece. Medea, who accompanied him from Colchis,
was in turn deserted by him.

[530] _Who in the next Bolgia wailed_: The flatterers in the Second
Bolgia.

[531] _Alessio Interminei_: Of the Great Lucchese family of the
Interminelli, to which the famous Castruccio Castrucani belonged.
Alessio is know to have been living in 1295. Dante may have known him
personally. Benvenuto says he was so liberal of his flattery that he
spent it even on menial servants.

[532] _Thais_: In the _Eunuch_ of Terence, Thraso, the lover of that
courtesan, asks Gnatho, their go-between, if she really sent him many
thanks for the present of a slave-girl he had sent her. 'Enormous!' says
Gnatho. It proves what great store Dante set on ancient instances when
he thought this worth citing.

[533] _Enough, etc._: Most readers will agree with Virgil.




CANTO XIX.


  O Simon Magus![534] ye his wretched crew!
    The gifts of God, ordained to be the bride
    Of righteousness, ye prostitute that you
  With gold and silver may be satisfied;
    Therefore for you let now the trumpet[535] blow,
    Seeing that ye in the Third Bolgia 'bide.
  Arrived at the next tomb,[536] we to the brow
    Of rock ere this had finished our ascent,
    Which hangs true plumb above the pit below.
  What perfect art, O Thou Omniscient,                              10
    Is Thine in Heaven and earth and the bad world found!
    How justly does Thy power its dooms invent!
  The livid stone, on both banks and the ground,
    I saw was full of holes on every side,
    All of one size, and each of them was round.
  No larger seemed they to me nor less wide
    Than those within my beautiful St. John[537]
    For the baptizers' standing-place supplied;
  And one of which, not many years agone,
    I broke to save one drowning; and I would                       20
    Have this for seal to undeceive men known.
  Out of the mouth of each were seen protrude
    A sinner's feet, and of the legs the small
    Far as the calves; the rest enveloped stood.
  And set on fire were both the soles of all,
    Which made their ankles wriggle with such throes
    As had made ropes and withes asunder fall.
  And as flame fed by unctuous matter goes
    Over the outer surface only spread;
    So from their heels it flickered to the toes.                   30
  'Master, who is he, tortured more,' I said,
    'Than are his neighbours, writhing in such woe;
    And licked by flames of deeper-hearted red?'
  And he: 'If thou desirest that below
    I bear thee by that bank[538] which lowest lies,
    Thou from himself his sins and name shalt know.'
  And I: 'Thy wishes still for me suffice:
    Thou art my Lord, and knowest I obey
    Thy will; and dost my hidden thoughts surprise.'
  To the fourth barrier then we made our way,                       40
    And, to the left hand turning, downward went
    Into the narrow hole-pierced cavity;
  Nor the good Master caused me make descent
    From off his haunch till we his hole were nigh
    Who with his shanks was making such lament.
  'Whoe'er thou art, soul full of misery,
    Set like a stake with lower end upcast,'
    I said to him, 'Make, if thou canst, reply.'
  I like a friar[539] stood who gives the last
    Shrift to a vile assassin, to his side                          50
    Called back to win delay for him fixed fast.
  'Art thou arrived already?' then he cried,
    'Art thou arrived already, Boniface?
    By several years the prophecy[540] has lied.
  Art so soon wearied of the wealthy place,
    For which thou didst not fear to take with guile,
    Then ruin the fair Lady?'[541] Now my case
  Was like to theirs who linger on, the while
    They cannot comprehend what they are told,
    And as befooled[542] from further speech resile.                60
  But Virgil bade me: 'Speak out loud and bold,
    "I am not he thou thinkest, no, not he!"'
    And I made answer as by him controlled.
  The spirit's feet then twisted violently,
    And, sighing in a voice of deep distress,
    He asked: 'What then requirest thou of me?
  If me to know thou hast such eagerness,
    That thou the cliff hast therefore ventured down,
    Know, the Great Mantle sometime was my dress.
  I of the Bear, in sooth, was worthy son:                          70
    As once, the Cubs to help, my purse with gain
    I stuffed, myself I in this purse have stown.
  Stretched out at length beneath my head remain
    All the simoniacs[543] that before me went,
    And flattened lie throughout the rocky vein.
  I in my turn shall also make descent,
    Soon as he comes who I believed thou wast,
    When I asked quickly what for him was meant.
  O'er me with blazing feet more time has past,
    While upside down I fill the topmost room,                      80
    Than he his crimsoned feet shall upward cast;
  For after him one viler still shall come,
    A Pastor from the West,[544] lawless of deed:
    To cover both of us his worthy doom.
  A modern Jason[545] he, of whom we read
    In Maccabees, whose King denied him nought:
    With the French King so shall this man succeed.'
  Perchance I ventured further than I ought,
    But I spake to him in this measure free:
    'Ah, tell me now what money was there sought                    90
  Of Peter by our Lord, when either key
    He gave him in his guardianship to hold?
    Sure He demanded nought save: "Follow me!"
  Nor Peter, nor the others, asked for gold
    Or silver when upon Matthias fell
    The lot instead of him, the traitor-souled.
  Keep then thy place, for thou art punished well,[546]
    And clutch the pelf, dishonourably gained,
    Which against Charles[547] made thee so proudly swell.
  And, were it not that I am still restrained                      100
    By reverence[548] for those tremendous keys,
    Borne by thee while the glad world thee contained,
  I would use words even heavier than these;
    Seeing your avarice makes the world deplore,
    Crushing the good, filling the bad with ease.
  'Twas you, O Pastors, the Evangelist bore
    In mind what time he saw her on the flood
    Of waters set, who played with kings the whore;
  Who with seven heads was born; and as she would
    By the ten horns to her was service done,                      110
    Long as her spouse[549] rejoiced in what was good.
  Now gold and silver are your god alone:
    What difference 'twixt the idolater and you,
    Save that ye pray a hundred for his one?
  Ah, Constantine,[550] how many evils grew--
    Not from thy change of faith, but from the gift
    Wherewith thou didst the first rich Pope endue!'
  While I my voice continued to uplift
    To such a tune, by rage or conscience stirred
    Both of his soles he made to twist and shift.                  120
  My Guide, I well believe, with pleasure heard;
    Listening he stood with lips so well content
    To me propounding truthful word on word.
  Then round my body both his arms he bent,
    And, having raised me well upon his breast,
    Climbed up the path by which he made descent.
  Nor was he by his burden so oppressed
    But that he bore me to the bridge's crown,
    Which with the fourth joins the fifth rampart's crest.
  And lightly here he set his burden down,                         130
    Found light by him upon the precipice,
    Up which a goat uneasily had gone.
  And thence another valley met mine eyes.


FOOTNOTES:

[534] _Simon Magus_: The sin of simony consists in setting a price on
the exercise of a spiritual grace or the acquisition of a spiritual
office. Dante assails it at headquarters, that is, as it was practised
by the Popes; and in their case it took, among other forms, that of
ecclesiastical nepotism.

[535] _The trumpet_: Blown at the punishment of criminals, to call
attention to their sentence.

[536] _The next tomb_: The Third Bolgia, appropriately termed a tomb,
because its manner of punishment is that of a burial, as will be seen.

[537] _St. John_: The church of St. John's, in Dante's time, as now, the
Baptistery of Florence. In _Parad._ xxv. he anticipates the day, if it
should ever come, when he shall return to Florence, and in the church
where he was baptized a Christian be crowned as a Poet. Down to the
middle of the sixteenth century all baptisms, except in cases of urgent
necessity, were celebrated in St. John's; and, even there, only on the
eves of Easter and Pentecost. For protection against the crowd, the
officiating priests were provided with standing-places, circular
cavities disposed around the great font. To these Dante compares the
holes of this Bolgia, for the sake of introducing a defence of himself
from a charge of sacrilege. Benvenuto tells that once when some boys
were playing about the church one of them, to hide himself from his
companions, squeezed himself into a baptizer's standing-place, and made
so tight a fit of it that he could not be rescued till Dante with his
own hands plied a hammer upon the marble, and so saved the child from
drowning. The presence of water in the cavity may be explained by the
fact of the church's being at that time lighted by an unglazed opening
in the roof; and as baptisms were so infrequent the standing-places,
situated as they were in the centre of the floor, may often have been
partially flooded. It is easy to understand how bitterly Dante would
resent a charge of irreverence connected with his 'beautiful St.
John's;' 'that fair sheep-fold' (_Parad._ xxv. 5).

[538] _That bank, etc._: Of each Bolgia the inner bank is lower than the
outer; the whole of Malebolge sloping towards the centre of the Inferno.

[539] _Like a friar, etc._: In those times the punishment of an assassin
was to be stuck head downward in a pit, and then to have earth slowly
shovelled in till he was suffocated. Dante bends down, the better to
hear what the sinner has to say, like a friar recalled by the felon on
the pretence that he has something to add to his confession.

[540] _The prophecy_: 'The writing.' The speaker is Nicholas III., of
the great Roman family of the Orsini, and Pope from 1277 to 1280; a man
of remarkable bodily beauty and grace of manner, as well as of great
force of character. Like many other Holy Fathers he was either a great
hypocrite while on his promotion, or else he degenerated very quickly
after getting himself well settled on the Papal Chair. He is said to
have been the first Pope who practised simony with no attempt at
concealment. Boniface VIII., whom he is waiting for to relieve him,
became Pope in 1294, and died in 1303. None of the four Popes between
1280 and 1294 were simoniacs; so that Nicholas was uppermost in the hole
for twenty-three years. Although ignorant of what is now passing on the
earth, he can refer back to his foreknowledge of some years earlier (see
_Inf._ x. 99) as if to a prophetic writing, and finds that according to
this it is still three years too soon, it being now only 1300, for the
arrival of Boniface. This is the usual explanation of the passage. To it
lies the objection that foreknowledge of the present that can be
referred back to is the same thing as knowledge of it, and with this the
spirits in Inferno are not endowed. But Dante elsewhere shows that he
finds it hard to observe the limitation. The alternative explanation,
supported by the use of _scritto_ (writing) in the text, is that
Nicholas refers to some prophecy once current about his successors in
Rome.

[541] _The fair Lady_: The Church. The guile is that shown by Boniface
in getting his predecessor Celestine v. to abdicate (_Inf._ iii. 60).

[542] _As befooled_: Dante does not yet suspect that it is with a Pope
he is speaking. He is dumbfounded at being addressed as Boniface.

[543] _All the simoniacs_: All the Popes that had been guilty of the
sin.

[544] _A Pastor from the West_: Boniface died in 1303, and was succeeded
by Benedict XI., who in his turn was succeeded by Clement V., the Pastor
from the West. Benedict was not stained with simony, and so it is
Clement that is to relieve Boniface; and he is to come from the West,
that is, from Avignon, to which the Holy See was removed by him. Or the
reference may simply be to the country of his birth. Elsewhere he is
spoken of as 'the Gascon who shall cheat the noble Henry' of Luxemburg
(_Parad._ xvii. 82).--This passage has been read as throwing light on
the question of when the _Inferno_ was written. Nicholas says that from
the time Boniface arrives till Clement relieves him will be a shorter
period than that during which he has himself been in Inferno, that is to
say, a shorter time than twenty years. Clement died in 1314; and so, it
is held, we find a date before which the _Inferno_ was, at least, not
published. But Clement was known for years before his death to be ill of
a disease usually soon fatal. He became Pope in 1305, and the wonder was
that he survived so long as nine years. Dante keeps his prophecy
safe--if it is a prophecy; and there does seem internal evidence to
prove the publication of the _Inferno_ to have taken place long before
1314.--It is needless to point out how the censure of Clement gains in
force if read as having been published before his death.

[545] _Jason_: Or Joshua, who purchased the office of High Priest from
Antiochus Epiphanes, and innovated the customs of the Jews (2 Maccab.
iv. 7).

[546] _Punished well_: At line 12 Dante has admired the propriety of the
Divine distribution of penalties. He appears to regard with a special
complacency that which he invents for the simoniacs. They were
industrious in multiplying benefices for their kindred; Boniface, for
example, besides Cardinals, appointed about twenty Archbishops and
Bishops from among his own relatives. Here all the simoniacal Popes have
to be contented with one place among them. They paid no regard to
whether a post was well filled or not: here they are set upside down.

[547] _Charles_: Nicholas was accused of taking a bribe to assist Peter
of Arragon in ousting Charles of Anjou from the kingdom of Sicily.

[548] _By reverence, etc._: Dante distinguishes between the office and
the unworthy holder of it. So in Purgatory he prostrates himself before
a Pope (_Purg._ xix. 131).

[549] _Her spouse_: In the preceding lines the vision of the Woman in
the Apocalypse is applied to the corruption of the Church, represented
under the figure of the seven-hilled Rome seated in honour among the
nations and receiving observance from the kings of the earth till her
spouse, the Pope, began to prostitute her by making merchandise of her
spiritual gifts. Of the Beast there is no mention here, his qualities
being attributed to the Woman.

[550] _Ah, Constantine, etc._: In Dante's time, and for some centuries
later, it was believed that Constantine, on transferring the seat of
empire to Byzantium, had made a gift to the Pope of rights and
privileges almost equal to those of the Emperor. Rome was to be the
Pope's; and from his court in the Lateran he was to exercise supremacy
over all the West. The Donation of Constantine, that is, the instrument
conveying these rights, was a forgery of the Middle Ages.




CANTO XX.


  Now of new torment must my verses tell,
    And matter for the Twentieth Canto win
    Of Lay the First,[551] which treats of souls in Hell.
  Already was I eager to begin
    To peer into the visible profound,[552]
    Which tears of agony was bathèd in:
  And I saw people in the valley round;
    Like that of penitents on earth the pace
    At which they weeping came, nor uttering[553] sound.
  When I beheld them with more downcast gaze,[554]                  10
    That each was strangely screwed about I learned,
    Where chest is joined to chin. And thus the face
  Of every one round to his loins was turned;
    And stepping backward[555] all were forced to go,
    For nought in front could be by them discerned.
  Smitten by palsy although one might show
    Perhaps a shape thus twisted all awry,
    I never saw, and am to think it slow.
  As, Reader,[556] God may grant thou profit by
    Thy reading, for thyself consider well                          20
    If I could then preserve my visage dry
  When close at hand to me was visible
    Our human form so wrenched that tears, rained down
    Out of the eyes, between the buttocks fell.
  In very sooth I wept, leaning upon
    A boss of the hard cliff, till on this wise
    My Escort asked: 'Of the other fools[557] art one?
  Here piety revives as pity dies;
    For who more irreligious is than he
    In whom God's judgments to regret give rise?                    30
  Lift up, lift up thy head, and thou shalt see
    Him for whom earth yawned as the Thebans saw,
    All shouting meanwhile: "Whither dost thou flee,
  Amphiaraüs?[558] Wherefore thus withdraw
    From battle?" But he sinking found no rest
    Till Minos clutched him with all-grasping claw.
  Lo, how his shoulders serve him for a breast!
    Because he wished to see too far before
    Backward he looks, to backward course addressed.
  Behold Tiresias,[559] who was changed all o'er,                   40
    Till for a man a woman met the sight,
    And not a limb its former semblance bore;
  And he behoved a second time to smite
    The same two twisted serpents with his wand,
    Ere he again in manly plumes was dight.
  With back to him, see Aruns next at hand,
    Who up among the hills of Luni, where
    Peasants of near Carrara till the land,
  Among the dazzling marbles[560] held his lair
    Within a cavern, whence could be descried                       50
    The sea and stars of all obstruction bare.
  The other one, whose flowing tresses hide
    Her bosom, of the which thou seest nought,
    And all whose hair falls on the further side,
  Was Manto;[561] who through many regions sought:
    Where I was born, at last her foot she stayed.
    It likes me well thou shouldst of this be taught.
  When from this life her father exit made,
    And Bacchus' city had become enthralled,
    She for long time through many countries strayed.               60
  'Neath mountains by which Germany is walled
    And bounded at Tirol, a lake there lies
    High in fair Italy, Benacus[562] called.
  The waters of a thousand springs that rise
    'Twixt Val Camonica and Garda flow
    Down Pennine; and their flood this lake supplies.
  And from a spot midway, if they should go
    Thither, the Pastors[563] of Verona, Trent,
    And Brescia might their blessings all bestow.
  Peschiera,[564] with its strength for ornament,                   70
    Facing the Brescians and the Bergamese
    Lies where the bank to lower curve is bent.
  And there the waters, seeking more of ease,
    For in Benacus is not room for all,
    Forming a river, lapse by green degrees.
  The river, from its very source, men call
    No more Benacus--'tis as Mincio known,
    Which into Po does at Governo fall.
  A flat it reaches ere it far has run,
    Spreading o'er which it feeds a marshy fen,                     80
    Whence oft in summer pestilence has grown.
  Wayfaring here the cruel virgin, when
    She found land girdled by the marshy flood,
    Untilled and uninhabited of men,
  That she might 'scape all human neighbourhood
    Stayed on it with her slaves, her arts to ply;
    And there her empty body was bestowed.
  On this the people from the country nigh
    Into that place came crowding, for the spot,
    Girt by the swamp, could all attack defy,                       90
  And for the town built o'er her body sought
    A name from her who made it first her seat,
    Calling it Mantua, without casting lot.[565]
  The dwellers in it were in number great,
    Till stupid Casalodi[566] was befooled
    And victimised by Pinamonte's cheat.
  Hence, shouldst thou ever hear (now be thou schooled!)
    Another story to my town assigned,
    Let by no fraud the truth be overruled.'
  And I: 'Thy reasonings, Master, to my mind                       100
    So cogent are, and win my faith so well,
    What others say I shall black embers find.
  But of this people passing onward tell,
    If thou, of any, something canst declare,
    For all my thoughts[567] on that intently dwell.'
  And then he said: 'The one whose bearded hair
    Falls from his cheeks upon his shoulders dun,
    Was, when the land of Greece[568] of males so bare
  Was grown the very cradles scarce held one,
    An augur;[569] he with Calchas gave the sign                   110
    In Aulis through the first rope knife to run.
  Eurypylus was he called, and in some line
    Of my high Tragedy[570] is sung the same,
    As thou know'st well, who mad'st it wholly thine.
  That other, thin of flank, was known to fame
    As Michael Scott;[571] and of a verity
    He knew right well the black art's inmost game.
  Guido Bonatti,[572] and Asdente see
    Who mourns he ever should have parted from
    His thread and leather; but too late mourns he.                120
  Lo the unhappy women who left loom,
    Spindle, and needle that they might divine;
    With herb and image[573] hastening men's doom.
  But come; for where the hemispheres confine
    Cain and the Thorns[574] is falling, to alight
    Underneath Seville on the ocean line.
  The moon was full already yesternight;
    Which to recall thou shouldst be well content,
    For in the wood she somewhat helped thy plight.'
  Thus spake he to me while we forward went.                       130


FOOTNOTES:

[551] _Lay the First_: The _Inferno_.

[552] _The visible profound_: The Fourth Bolgia, where soothsayers of
every kind are punished. Their sin is that of seeking to find out what
God has made secret. That such discoveries of the future could be made
by men, Dante seems to have had no doubt; but he regards the exercise of
the power as a fraud on Providence, and also credits the adepts in the
black art with ruining others by their spells (line 123).

[553] _Nor uttering, etc._: They who on earth told too much are now
condemned to be for ever dumb. It will be noticed that with none of them
does Dante converse.

[554] _More downcast gaze_: Standing as he does on the crown of the
arch, the nearer they come to him the more he has to decline his eyes.

[555] _Stepping backward_: Once they peered far into the future; now
they cannot see a step before them.

[556]_ As, Reader, etc._: Some light may be thrown on this unusual, and,
at first sight, inexplicable display of pity, by the comment of
Benvenuto da Imola:--'It is the wisest and most virtuous of men that are
most subject to this mania of divination; and of this Dante is himself
an instance, as is well proved by this book of his.' Dante reminds the
reader how often since the journey began he has sought to have the veil
of the future lifted; and would have it understood that he was seized by
a sudden misgiving as to whether he too had not overstepped the bounds
of what, in that respect, is allowed and right.

[557] _Of the other fools_: Dante, weeping like the sinners in the
Bolgia, is asked by Virgil: 'What, art thou then one of them?' He had
been suffered, without reproof, to show pity for Francesca and Ciacco.
The terrors of the Lord grow more cogent as they descend, and even pity
is now forbidden.

[558] _Amphiaraüs_: One of the Seven Kings who besieged Thebes. He
foresaw his own death, and sought by hiding to evade it; but his wife
revealed his hiding-place, and he was forced to join in the siege. As he
fought, a thunderbolt opened a chasm in the earth, into which he fell.

[559] _Tiresias_: A Theban soothsayer whose change of sex is described
by Ovid (_Metam._ iii.).

[560] _The dazzling marbles_: Aruns, a Tuscan diviner, is introduced by
Lucan as prophesying great events to come to pass in Rome--the Civil War
and the victories of Cæsar. His haunt was the deserted city of Luna,
situated on the Gulf of Spezia, and under the Carrara mountains
(_Phars._ i. 586).

[561] _Manto_: A prophetess, a native of Thebes the city of Bacchus, and
daughter of Tiresias.--Here begins a digression on the early history of
Mantua, the native city of Virgil. In his account of the foundation of
it Dante does not agree with Virgil, attributing to a Greek Manto what
his master attributes to an Italian one (_Æn._ x. 199).

[562] _Benacus_: The ancient Benacus, now known as the Lake of Garda.

[563] _The Pastors, etc._: About half-way down the western side of the
lake a stream falls into it, one of whose banks, at its mouth, is in the
diocese of Trent, and the other in that of Brescia, while the waters of
the lake are in that of Verona. The three Bishops, standing together,
could give a blessing each to his own diocese.

[564] _Peschiera_: Where the lake drains into the Mincio. It is still a
great fortress.

[565] _Without casting lot_; Without consulting the omens, as was usual
when a city was to be named.

[566] _Casalodi_: Some time in the second half of the thirteenth century
Alberto Casalodi was befooled out of the lordship of Mantua by Pinamonte
Buonacolsi. Benvenuto tells the tale as follows:--Pinamonte was a bold,
ambitious man, with a great troop of armed followers; and, the nobility
being at that time in bad odour with the people at large, he persuaded
the Count Albert that it would be a popular measure to banish the
suspected nobles for a time. Hardly was this done when he usurped the
lordship; and by expelling some of the citizens and putting others of
them to death he greatly thinned the population of the city.

[567] _All my thoughts, etc._: The reader's patience is certainly abused
by this digression of Virgil's, and Dante himself seems conscious that
it is somewhat ill-timed.

[568] _The land of Greece, etc._: All the Greeks able to bear arms being
engaged in the Trojan expedition.

[569] _An augur_: Eurypylus, mentioned in the Second _Æneid_ as being
employed by the Greeks to consult the oracle of Apollo regarding their
return to Greece. From the auspices Calchas had found at what hour they
should set sail for Troy. Eurypylus can be said only figuratively to
have had to do with cutting the cable.

[570] _Tragedy_: The _Æneid_. Dante defines Comedy as being written in a
style inferior to that of Tragedy, and as having a sad beginning and a
happy ending (Epistle to Can Grande, 10). Elsewhere he allows the comic
poet great licence in the use of common language (_Vulg. El._ ii. 4). By
calling his own poem a Comedy he, as it were, disarms criticism.

[571] _Michael Scott_: Of Balwearie in Scotland, familiar to English
readers through the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_. He flourished in the
course of the thirteenth century, and made contributions to the
sciences, as they were then deemed, of astrology, alchemy, and
physiognomy. He acted for some time as astrologer to the Emperor
Frederick II., and the tradition of his accomplishments powerfully
affected the Italian imagination for a century after his death. It was
remembered that the terrible Frederick, after being warned by him to
beware of Florence, had died at a place called Firenzuola; and more than
one Italian city preserved with fear and trembling his dark sayings
regarding their fate. Villani frequently quotes his prophecies; and
Boccaccio speaks of him as a great necromancer who had been in Florence.
A commentary of his on Aristotle was printed at Venice in 1496. The
thinness of his flanks may refer to a belief that he could make himself
invisible at will.

[572] _Guido Bonatti_: Was a Florentine, a tiler by trade, and was
living in 1282. When banished from his own city he took refuge at Forlì
and became astrologer to Guido of Montefeltro (_Inf._ xxvii.), and was
credited with helping his master to a great victory.--_Asdente_: A
cobbler of Parma, whose prophecies were long renowned, lived in the
twelfth century. He is given in the _Convito_ (iv. 16) as an instance
that a man may be very notorious without being truly noble.

[573] _Herb and image_: Part of the witch's stock in trade. All that was
done to a waxen image of him was suffered by the witch's victim.

[574] _Cain and the Thorns_: The moon. The belief that the spots in the
moon are caused by Cain standing in it with a bundle of thorns is
referred to at _Parad._ ii. 51. Although it is now the morning of the
Saturday, the 'yesternight' refers to the night of Thursday, when Dante
found some use of the moon in the Forest. The moon is now setting on the
line dividing the hemisphere of Jerusalem, in which they are, from that
of the Mount of Purgatory. According to Dante's scheme of the world,
Purgatory is the true opposite of Jerusalem; and Seville is ninety
degrees from Jerusalem. As it was full moon the night before last, and
the moon is now setting, it is now fully an hour after sunrise. But, as
has already been said, it is not possible to reconcile the astronomical
indications thoroughly with one another.--Virgil serves as clock to
Dante, for they can see nothing of the skies.




CANTO XXI.


  Conversing still from bridge to bridge[575] we went;
    But what our words I in my Comedy
    Care not to tell. The top of the ascent
  Holding, we halted the next pit to spy
    Of Malebolge, with plaints bootless all:
    There, darkness[576] full of wonder met the eye.
  As the Venetians[577] in their Arsenal
    Boil the tenacious pitch at winter-tide,
    To caulk the ships with for repairs that call;
  For then they cannot sail; and so, instead,                       10
    One builds his bark afresh, one stops with tow
    His vessel's ribs, by many a voyage tried;
  One hammers at the poop, one at the prow;
    Some fashion oars, and others cables twine,
    And others at the jib and main sails sew:
  So, not by fire, but by an art Divine,
    Pitch of thick substance boiled in that low Hell,
    And all the banks did as with plaster line.
  I saw it, but distinguished nothing well
    Except the bubbles by the boiling raised,                       20
    Now swelling up and ceasing now to swell.
  While down upon it fixedly I gazed,
    'Beware, beware!' my Leader to me said,
    And drew me thence close to him. I, amazed,
  Turned sharply round, like him who has delayed,
    Fain to behold the thing he ought to flee,
    Then, losing nerve, grows suddenly afraid,
  Nor lingers longer what there is to see;
    For a black devil I beheld advance
    Over the cliff behind us rapidly.                               30
  Ah me, how fierce was he of countenance!
    What bitterness he in his gesture put,
    As with spread wings he o'er the ground did dance!
  Upon his shoulders, prominent and acute,
    Was perched a sinner[578] fast by either hip;
    And him he held by tendon of the foot.
  He from our bridge: 'Ho, Malebranche![579] Grip
    An Elder brought from Santa Zita's town:[580]
    Stuff him below; myself once more I slip
  Back to the place where lack of such is none.                     40
    There, save Bonturo, barrates[581] every man,
    And No grows Yes that money may be won.'
  He shot him down, and o'er the cliff began
    To run; nor unchained mastiff o'er the ground,
    Chasing a robber, swifter ever ran.
  The other sank, then rose with back bent round;
    But from beneath the bridge the devils cried:
    'Not here the Sacred Countenance[582] is found,
  One swims not here as on the Serchio's[583] tide;
    So if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal                  50
    Do not on surface of the pitch abide.'
  Then he a hundred hooks[584] was made to feel.
    'Best dance down there,' they said the while to him,
    'Where, if thou canst, thou on the sly mayst steal.'
  So scullions by the cooks are set to trim
    The caldrons and with forks the pieces steep
    Down in the water, that they may not swim.
  And the good Master said to me: 'Now creep
    Behind a rocky splinter for a screen;
    So from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep.                60
  And fear not thou although with outrage keen
    I be opposed, for I am well prepared,
    And formerly[585] have in like contest been.'
  Then passing from the bridge's crown he fared
    To the sixth bank,[586] and when thereon he stood
    He needed courage doing what he dared.
  In the same furious and tempestuous mood
    In which the dogs upon the beggar leap,
    Who, halting suddenly, seeks alms or food,
  They issued forth from underneath the deep                        70
    Vault of the bridge, with grapplers 'gainst him stretched;
    But he exclaimed: 'Aloof, and harmless keep!
  Ere I by any of your hooks be touched,
    Come one of you and to my words give ear;
    And then advise you if I should be clutched.'
  All cried: 'Let Malacoda then go near;'
    On which one moved, the others standing still.
    He coming said: 'What will this[587] help him here?'
  'O Malacoda, is it credible
    That I am come,' my Master then replied,                        80
    'Secure your opposition to repel,
  Without Heaven's will, and fate, upon my side?
    Let me advance, for 'tis by Heaven's behest
    That I on this rough road another guide.'
  Then was his haughty spirit so depressed,
    He let his hook drop sudden to his feet,
    And, 'Strike him not!' commanded all the rest
  My Leader charged me thus: 'Thou, from thy seat
    Where 'mid the bridge's ribs thou crouchest low,
    Rejoin me now in confidence complete.'                          90
  Whereon I to rejoin him was not slow;
    And then the devils, crowding, came so near,
    I feared they to their paction false might show.
  So at Caprona[588] saw I footmen fear,
    Spite of their treaty, when a multitude
    Of foes received them, crowding front and rear.
  With all my body braced I closer stood
    To him, my Leader, and intently eyed
    The aspect of them, which was far from good.
  Lowering their grapplers, 'mong themselves they cried:
    'Shall I now tickle him upon the thigh?'                       101
    'Yea, see thou clip him deftly,' one replied.
  The demon who in parley had drawn nigh
    Unto my Leader, upon this turned round;
    'Scarmiglione, lay thy weapon by!'
  He said; and then to us: 'No way is found
    Further along this cliff, because, undone,
    All the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground.
  But if it please you further to pass on,
    Over this rocky ridge advancing climb                          110
    To the next rib,[589] where passage may be won.
  Yestreen,[590] but five hours later than this time,
    Twelve hundred sixty-six years reached an end,
    Since the way lost the wholeness of its prime.
  Thither I some of mine will straightway send
    To see that none peer forth to breathe the air:
    Go on with them; you they will not offend.
  You, Alichin[591] and Calcabrin, prepare
    To move,' he bade; 'Cagnazzo, thou as well;
    Guiding the ten, thou, Barbariccia, fare.                      120
  With Draghignazzo, Libicocco fell,
    Fanged Ciriatto, Graffiacane too,
    Set on, mad Rubicant and Farfarel:
  Search on all quarters round the boiling glue.
    Let these go safe, till at the bridge they be,
    Which doth unbroken[592] o'er the caverns go.'
  'Alas, my Master, what is this I see?'
    Said I, 'Unguided, let us forward set,
    If thou know'st how. I wish no company.
  If former caution thou dost not forget,                          130
    Dost thou not mark how each his teeth doth grind,
    The while toward us their brows are full of threat?'
  And he: 'I would not fear should fill thy mind;
   Let them grin all they will, and all they can;
    'Tis at the wretches in the pitch confined.'
  They wheeled and down the left hand bank began
    To march, but first each bit his tongue,[593] and passed
    The signal on to him who led the van.
  He answered grossly as with trumpet blast.


FOOTNOTES:

[575] _From bridge to bridge_: They cross the barrier separating the
Fourth from the Fifth Bolgia, and follow the bridge which spans the
Fifth until they have reached the crown of it. We may infer that the
conversation of Virgil and Dante turned on foreknowledge of the future.

[576] _Darkness, etc._: The pitch with which the trench of the Bolgia is
filled absorbs most of the scanty light accorded to Malebolge.

[577] _The Venetians_: But for this picturesque description of the old
Arsenal, and a passing mention of the Rialto in one passage of the
_Paradiso_, and of the Venetian coinage in another, it could not be
gathered from the _Comedy_, with all its wealth of historical and
geographical references, that there was such a place as Venice in the
Italy of Dante. Unlike the statue of Time (_Inf._ xiv.), the Queen of
the Adriatic had her face set eastwards. Her back was turned and her
ears closed as in a proud indifference to the noise of party conflicts
which filled the rest of Italy.

[578] _A sinner_: This is the only instance in the _Inferno_ of the
arrival of a sinner at his special place of punishment. See _Inf._ v.
15, _note_.

[579] _Malebranche_: Evil Claws, the name of the devils who have the
sinners of this Bolgia in charge.

[580] _Santa Zita's town_: Zita was a holy serving-woman of Lucca, who
died some time between 1270 and 1280, and whose miracle-working body is
still preserved in the church of San Frediano. Most probably, although
venerated as a saint, she was not yet canonized at the time Dante writes
of, and there may be a Florentine sneer hidden in the description of
Lucca as her town. Even in Lucca there was some difference of opinion as
to her merits, and a certain unlucky Ciappaconi was pitched into the
Serchio for making fun of the popular enthusiasm about her. See
Philalethes, _Gött. Com._ In Lucca the officials that were called Priors
in Florence, were named Elders. The commentators give a name to this
sinner, but it is only guesswork.

[581] _Save Bonturo_, _barrates, etc._: It is the barrators, those who
trafficked in offices and sold justice, that are punished in this
Bolgia. The greatest barrator of all in Lucca, say the commentators, was
this Bonturo; but there seems no proof of it, though there is of his
arrogance. He was still living in 1314.

[582] _The Sacred Countenance_: An image in cedar wood, of Byzantine
workmanship, still preserved and venerated in the cathedral of Lucca.
According to the legend, it was carved from memory by Nicodemus, and
after being a long time lost was found again in the eighth century by an
Italian bishop travelling in Palestine. He brought it to the coast at
Joppa, where it was received by a vessel without sail or oar, which,
with its sacred freight, floated westwards and was next seen at the port
of Luna. All efforts to approach the bark were vain, till the Bishop of
Lucca descended to the seashore, and to him the vessel resigned itself
and suffered him to take the image into his keeping. 'Believe what you
like of all this,' says Benvenuto; 'it is no article of faith.'--The
sinner has come to the surface, bent as if in an attitude of prayer,
when he is met by this taunt.

[583] _The Serchio_: The stream which flows past Lucca.

[584] _A hundred hooks_: So many devils with their pronged hooks were
waiting to receive the victim. The punishment of the barrators bears a
relation to their sins. They wrought their evil deeds under all kinds of
veils and excuses, and are now themselves effectually buried out of
sight. The pitch sticks as close to them as bribes ever did to their
fingers. They misused wards and all subject to them, and in their turn
are clawed and torn by their devilish guardians.

[585] _Formerly, etc._: On the occasion of his previous descent (_Inf._
ix. 22).

[586] _The sixth bank_: Dante remains on the crown of the arch
overhanging the pitch-filled moat. Virgil descends from the bridge by
the left hand to the bank on the inner side of the Fifth Bolgia.

[587] _What will this, etc._: As if he said: What good will this delay
do him in the long-run?

[588] _At Caprona_: Dante was one of the mounted militia sent by
Florence in 1289 to help the Lucchese against the Pisans, and was
present at the surrender by the Pisan garrison of the Castle of Caprona.
Some make the reference to be to a siege of the same stronghold by the
Pisans in the following year, when the Lucchese garrison, having
surrendered on condition of having their lives spared, were met as they
issued forth with cries of 'Hang them! Hang them!' But of this second
siege it is only a Pisan commentator that speaks.

[589] _The next rib_: Malacoda informs them that the arch of rock across
the Sixth Bolgia in continuation of that by which they have crossed the
Fifth is in ruins, but that they will find a whole bridge if they keep
to the left hand along the rocky bank on the inner edge of the
pitch-filled moat. But, as appears further on, he is misleading them. It
will be remembered that from the precipice enclosing the Malebolge there
run more than one series of bridges or ribs into the central well of
Inferno.

[590] _Yestreen, etc._: This is the principal passage in the _Comedy_
for fixing the date of the journey. It is now, according to the text,
twelve hundred and sixty-six years and a day since the crucifixion.
Turning to the _Convito_, iv. 23, we find Dante giving his reasons for
believing that Jesus, at His death, had just completed His thirty-fourth
year. This brings us to the date of 1300 A.D. But according to Church
tradition the crucifixion happened on the 25th March, and to get
thirty-four years His life must be counted from the incarnation, which
was held to have taken place on the same date, namely the 25th March. It
was in Dante's time optional to reckon from the incarnation or the birth
of Christ. The journey must therefore be taken to have begun on Friday
the 25th March, a fortnight before the Good Friday of 1300; and,
counting strictly from the incarnation, on the first day of 1301--the
first day of the new century. So we find Boccaccio in his unfinished
commentary saying in _Inf._ iii. that it will appear from Canto xxi.
that Dante began his journey in MCCCI.--The hour is now five hours
before that at which the earthquake happened which took place at the
death of Jesus. This is held by Dante (_Convito_ iv. 23), who professes
to follow the account by Saint Luke, to have been at the sixth hour,
that is, at noon; thus the time is now seven in the morning.

[591] _Alichino, etc._: The names of the devils are all descriptive:
Alichino, for instance, is the Swooper; but in this and the next Canto
we have enough of the horrid crew without considering too closely how
they are called.

[592] _Unbroken_: Malacoda repeats his lie.

[593] _Each bit his tongue, etc._: The demons, aware of the cheat played
by Malacoda, show their devilish humour by making game of Virgil and
Dante.--Benvenuto is amazed that a man so involved in his own thoughts
as Dante was, should have been such a close observer of low life as this
passage shows him. He is sure that he laughed to himself as he wrote the
Canto.




CANTO XXII.


  Horsemen I've seen in march across the field,
    Hastening to charge, or, answering muster, stand,
    And sometimes too when forced their ground to yield;
  I have seen skirmishers upon your land,
    O Aretines![594] and those on foray sent;
    With trumpet and with bell[595] to sound command
  Have seen jousts run and well-fought tournament,
    With drum, and signal from the castle shown,
    And foreign music with familiar blent;
  But ne'er by blast on such a trumpet blown                        10
    Beheld I horse or foot to motion brought,
    Nor ship by star or landmark guided on.
  With the ten demons moved we from the spot;
    Ah, cruel company! but 'with the good
    In church, and in the tavern with the sot.'
  Still to the pitch was my attention glued
    Fully to see what in the Bolgia lay,
    And who were in its burning mass imbrued.
  As when the dolphins vaulted backs display,
    Warning to mariners they should prepare                         20
    To trim their vessel ere the storm makes way;
  So, to assuage the pain he had to bear,
    Some wretch would show his back above the tide,
    Then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air.
  And as the frogs close to the marsh's side
    With muzzles thrust out of the water stand,
    While feet and bodies carefully they hide;
  So stood the sinners upon every hand.
    But on beholding Barbariccia nigh
    Beneath the bubbles[596] disappeared the band.                  30
  I saw what still my heart is shaken by:
    One waiting, as it sometimes comes to pass
    That one frog plunges, one at rest doth lie;
  And Graffiacan, who nearest to him was,
    Him upward drew, clutching his pitchy hair:
    To me he bore the look an otter has.
  I of their names[597] ere this was well aware,
    For I gave heed unto the names of all
    When they at first were chosen. 'Now prepare,
  And, Rubicante, with thy talons fall                              40
    Upon him and flay well,' with many cries
    And one consent the accursed ones did call.
  I said: 'O Master, if in any wise
    Thou canst, find out who is the wretched wight
    Thus at the mercy of his enemies.'
  Whereon my Guide drew full within his sight,
    Asking him whence he came, and he replied:
    'In kingdom of Navarre[598] I first saw light.
  Me servant to a lord my mother tied;
    Through her I from a scoundrel sire did spring,                 50
    Waster of goods and of himself beside.
  As servant next to Thiebault,[599] righteous king,
    I set myself to ply barratorship;
    And in this heat discharge my reckoning.'
  And Ciriatto, close upon whose lip
    On either side a boar-like tusk did stand,
    Made him to feel how one of them could rip.
  The mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band;
    But Barbariccia locked him in embrace,
    And, 'Off while I shall hug him!' gave command.                 60
  Round to my Master then he turned his face:
    'Ask more of him if more thou wouldest know,
    While he against their fury yet finds grace.'
  My Leader asked: 'Declare now if below
    The pitch 'mong all the guilty there lies here
    A Latian?'[600] He replied: 'Short while ago
  From one[601] I parted who to them lived near;
    And would that I might use him still for shield,
    Then hook or claw I should no longer fear,'
  Said Libicocco: 'Too much grace we yield.'                        70
    And in the sinner's arm he fixed his hook,
    And from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled.
  But seeing Draghignazzo also took
    Aim at his legs, the leader of the Ten
    Turned swiftly round on them with angry look.
  On this they were a little quieted; then
    Of him who still gazed on his wound my Guide
    Without delay demanded thus again:
  'Who was it whom, in coming to the side,
    Thou say'st thou didst do ill to leave behind?'                 80
    'Gomita of Gallura,'[602] he replied,
  'A vessel full of fraud of every kind,
    Who, holding in his power his master's foes,
    So used them him they bear in thankful mind;
  For, taking bribes, he let slip all of those,
    He says; and he in other posts did worse,
    And as a chieftain 'mong barrators rose.
  Don Michael Zanche[603] doth with him converse,
   From Logodoro, and with endless din
    They gossip[604] of Sardinian characters.                       90
  But look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin.
    More would I say, but that I am afraid
    He is about to claw me on the skin.'
  To Farfarel the captain turned his head,
    For, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye,
    And, 'Cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!' said.
  'If ye would talk with, or would closer spy,'
    The frighted wretch began once more to say,
    'Tuscans or Lombards, I will bring them nigh.
  But let the Malebranche first give way,                          100
    That of their vengeance they may not have fear,
    And I to this same place where now I stay
  For me, who am but one, will bring seven near
    When I shall whistle as we use to do
    Whenever on the surface we appear.'
  On this Cagnazzo up his muzzle threw,
    Shaking his head and saying: 'Hear the cheat
    He has contrived, to throw himself below.'
  Then he who in devices was complete:
    'Far too malicious, in good sooth,' replied,                   110
    'When for my friends I plan a sorer fate.'
  This, Alichin withstood not but denied
    The others' counsel,[605] saying: 'If thou fling
    Thyself hence, thee I strive not to outstride.
  But o'er the pitch I'll dart upon the wing.
    Leave we the ridge,[606] and be the bank a shield;
    And see if thou canst all of us outspring.'
  O Reader, hear a novel trick revealed.
    All to the other side turned round their eyes,
    He first[607] who slowest was the boon to yield.               120
  In choice of time the Navarrese was wise;
    Taking firm stand, himself he forward flung,
    Eluding thus their hostile purposes.
  Then with compunction each of them was stung,
    But he the most[608] whose slackness made them fail;
    Therefore he started, 'Caught!' upon his tongue.
  But little it bested, nor could prevail
    His wings 'gainst fear. Below the other went,
    While he with upturned breast aloft did sail.
  And as the falcon, when, on its descent,                         130
    The wild duck suddenly dives out of sight,
    Returns outwitted back, and malcontent;
  To be befooled filled Calcabrin with spite.
    Hovering he followed, wishing in his mind
    The wretch escaping should leave cause for fight.
  When the barrator vanished, from behind
    He on his comrade with his talons fell
    And clawed him, 'bove the moat with him entwined.
  The other was a spar-hawk terrible
    To claw in turn; together then the two                         140
    Plunged in the boiling pool. The heat full well
  How to unlock their fierce embraces knew;
    But yet they had no power[609] to rise again,
    So were their wings all plastered o'er with glue.
  Then Barbariccia, mourning with his train,
    Caused four to fly forth to the other side
    With all their grapplers. Swift their flight was ta'en.
  Down to the place from either hand they glide,
    Reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast,
    And now beneath the scum were being fried.                     150
  And from them thus engaged we onward passed.


FOOTNOTES:

[594] _O Aretines_: Dante is mentioned as having taken part in the
campaign of 1289 against Arezzo, in the course of which the battle of
Campaldino was fought. But the text can hardly refer to what he
witnessed in that campaign, as the field of it was almost confined to
the Casentino, and little more than a formal entrance was made on the
true Aretine territory; while the chronicles make no mention of jousts
and forays. There is, however, no reason to think but that Dante was
engaged in the attack made by Florence on the Ghibeline Arezzo in the
early summer of the preceding year. In a few days the Florentines and
their allies had taken above forty castles and strongholds, and
devastated the enemy's country far and near; and, though unable to take
the capital, they held all kinds of warlike games in front of it. Dante
was then twenty-three years of age, and according to the Florentine
constitution of that period would, in a full muster of the militia, be
required to serve as a cavalier without pay, and providing his own horse
and arms.

[595] _Bell_: The use of the bell for martial music was common in the
Italy of the thirteenth century. The great war-bell of the Florentines
was carried with them into the field.

[596] _Beneath the bubbles, etc._: As the barrators took toll of the
administration of justice and appointment to offices, something always
sticking to their palms, so now they are plunged in the pitch; and as
they denied to others what should be the common blessing of justice, now
they cannot so much as breathe the air without paying dearly for it to
the demons.

[597] _Their names_: The names of all the demons. All of them urge
Rubicante, the 'mad red devil,' to flay the victim, shining and sleek
with the hot pitch, who is held fast by Graffiacane.

[598] _In kingdom of Navarre, etc._: The commentators give the name of
John Paul to this shade, but all that is known of him is found in the
text.

[599] _Thiebault_: King of Navarre and second of that name. He
accompanied his father-in-law, Saint Louis, to Tunis, and died on his
way back, in 1270.

[600] _A Latian_: An Italian.

[601] _From one, etc._: A Sardinian. The barrator prolongs his answer so
as to procure a respite from the fangs of his tormentors.

[602] _Gomita of Gallura_: 'Friar Gomita' was high in favour with Nino
Visconti (_Purg._ viii. 53), the lord of Gallura, one of the provinces
into which Sardinia was divided under the Pisans. At last, after bearing
long with him, the 'gentle Judge Nino' hanged Gomita for setting
prisoners free for bribes.

[603] _Don Michael Zanche_: Enzo, King of Sardinia, married Adelasia,
the lady of Logodoro, one of the four Sardinian judgedoms or provinces.
Of this province Zanche, seneschal to Enzo, acquired the government
during the long imprisonment of his master, or upon his death in 1273.
Zanche's daughter was married to Branca d'Oria, by whom Zanche was
treacherously slain in 1275 (_Inf._ xxxiii. 137). There seems to be
nothing extant to support the accusation implied in the text.

[604] _They gossip, etc._: Zanche's experience of Sardinia was of an
earlier date than Gomita's. It has been claimed for, or charged against,
the Sardinians, that more than other men they delight in gossip touching
their native country. These two, if it can be supposed that, plunged
among and choked with pitch, they still cared for Sardinian talk, would
find material enough in the troubled history of their land. In 1300 it
belonged partly to Genoa and partly to Pisa.

[605] _The others' counsel_: Alichino, confident in his own powers, is
willing to risk an experiment with the sinner. The other devils count a
bird in the hand worth two in the bush.

[606] _The ridge_: Not the crown of the great rocky barrier between the
Fifth and the Sixth Bolgias, for it is not on that the devils are
standing; neither are they allowed to pass over it (_Inf._ xxiii. 55).
We are to figure them to ourselves as standing on a ledge running
between the fosse and the foot of the enclosing rocky steep--a pathway
continued under the bridges and all round the Bolgia for their
convenience as guardians of it. The bank adjoining the pitch will serve
as a screen for the sinner if the demons retire to the other side of
this ledge.

[607] _He first, etc._: Cagnazzo. See line 106.

[608] _He the most, etc._: Alichino, whose confidence in his agility had
led to the outwitting of the band.

[609] _No power_: The foolish ineptitude of the devils for anything
beyond their special function of hooking up and flaying those who appear
on the surface of the pitch, and their irrational fierce playfulness as
of tiger cubs, convey a vivid impression of the limits set to their
diabolical power, and at the same time heighten the sense of what
Dante's feeling of insecurity must have been while in such inhuman
companionship.




CANTO XXIII.


  Silent, alone, not now with company
    We onward went, one first and one behind,
    As Minor Friars[610] use to make their way.
  On Æsop's fable[611] wholly was my mind
    Intent, by reason of that contest new--
    The fable where the frog and mouse we find;
  For _Mo_ and _Issa_[612] are not more of hue
    Than like the fable shall the fact appear,
    If but considered with attention due.
  And as from one thought springs the next, so here                 10
    Out of my first arose another thought,
    Until within me doubled was my fear.
  For thus I judged: Seeing through us[613] were brought
    Contempt upon them, hurt, and sore despite,
    They needs must be to deep vexation wrought.
  If anger to malevolence unite,
    Then will they us more cruelly pursue
    Than dog the hare which almost feels its bite.
  All my hair bristled, I already knew,
    With terror when I spake: 'O Master, try                        20
    To hide us quick' (and back I turned to view
  What lay behind), 'for me they terrify,
    These Malebranche following us; from dread
    I almost fancy I can feel them nigh.'
  And he: 'Were I a mirror backed with lead
    I should no truer glass that form of thine,
    Than all thy thought by mine is answered.
  For even now thy thoughts accord with mine,
    Alike in drift and featured with one face;
    And to suggest one counsel they combine.                        30
  If the right bank slope downward at this place,
    To the next Bolgia[614] offering us a way,
    Swiftly shall we evade the imagined chase.'
  Ere he completely could his purpose say,
    I saw them with their wings extended wide,
    Close on us; as of us to make their prey.
  Then quickly was I snatched up by my Guide:
    Even as a mother when, awaked by cries,
    She sees the flames are kindling at her side,
  Delaying not, seizes her child and flies;                         40
    Careful for him her proper danger mocks,
    Nor even with one poor shift herself supplies.
  And he, stretched out upon the flinty rocks,
    Himself unto the precipice resigned
    Which one side of the other Bolgia blocks.
  A swifter course ne'er held a stream confined,
    That it may turn a mill, within its race,
    Where near the buckets 'tis the most declined
  Than was my Master's down that rock's sheer face;
    Nor seemed I then his comrade, as we sped,                      50
    But like a son locked in a sire's embrace.
  And barely had his feet struck on the bed
    Of the low ground, when they were seen to stand
    Upon the crest, no more a cause of dread.[615]
  For Providence supreme, who so had planned
    In the Fifth Bolgia they should minister,
    Them wholly from departure thence had banned.
  'Neath us we saw a painted people fare,
    Weeping as on their way they circled slow,
    Crushed by fatigue to look at, and despair.                     60
  Cloaks had they on with hoods pulled down full low
    Upon their eyes, and fashioned, as it seemed,
    Like those which at Cologne[616] for monks they sew.
  The outer face was gilt so that it gleamed;
    Inside was all of lead, of such a weight
    Frederick's[617] to these had been but straw esteemed.
  O weary robes for an eternal state!
    With them we turned to the left hand once more,
    Intent upon their tears disconsolate.
  But those folk, wearied with the loads they bore,                 70
    So slowly crept that still new company
    Was ours at every footfall on the floor.
  Whence to my Guide I said: 'Do thou now try
    To find some one by name or action known,
    And as we go on all sides turn thine eye.'
  And one, who recognised the Tuscan tone,
    Called from behind us: 'Halt, I you entreat
    Who through the air obscure are hastening on;
  Haply in me thou what thou seek'st shalt meet.'
    Whereon my Guide turned round and said: 'Await,
    And keep thou time with pacing of his feet.'                    81
  I stood, and saw two manifesting great
    Desire to join me, by their countenance;
    But their loads hampered them and passage strait.[618]
  And, when arrived, me with an eye askance[619]
    They gazed on long time, but no word they spoke;
    Then, to each other turned, held thus parlance:
  'His heaving throat[620] proves him of living folk.
    If they are of the dead, how could they gain
    To walk uncovered by the heavy cloak?'                          90
  Then to me: 'Tuscan, who dost now attain
    To the college of the hypocrites forlorn,
    To tell us who thou art show no disdain.'
  And I to them: 'I was both bred and born
    In the great city by fair Arno's stream,
    And wear the body I have always worn.
  But who are ye, whose suffering supreme
    Makes tears, as I behold, to flood the cheek;
    And what your mode of pain that thus doth gleam?'
  'Ah me, the yellow mantles,' one to speak                        100
    Began, 'are all of lead so thick, its weight
    Maketh the scales after this manner creak.
  We, Merry Friars[621] of Bologna's state,
    I Catalano, Loderingo he,
    Were by thy town together designate,
  As for the most part one is used to be,
    To keep the peace within it; and around
    Gardingo,[622] what we were men still may see.'
  I made beginning: 'Friars, your profound--'
    But said no more, on suddenly seeing there                     110
    One crucified by three stakes to the ground,
  Who, when he saw me, writhed as in despair,
    Breathing into his beard with heavy sigh.
    And Friar Catalan, of this aware,
  Said: 'He thus fixed, on whom thou turn'st thine eye,
    Counselled the Pharisees that it behoved
    One man as victim[623] for the folk should die.
  Naked, thou seest, he lies, and ne'er removed
    From where, set 'cross the path, by him the weight
    Of every one that passes by is proved.                         120
  And his wife's father shares an equal fate,
    With others of the Council, in this fosse;
    For to the Jews they proved seed reprobate.'
  Meanwhile at him thus stretched upon the cross
    Virgil,[624] I saw, displayed astonishment--
    At his mean exile and eternal loss.
  And then this question to the Friars he sent:
    'Be not displeased, but, if ye may, avow
    If on the right[625] hand there lies any vent
  By which we, both of us,[626] from hence may go,                 130
    Nor need the black angelic company
    To come to help us from this valley low.'
  'Nearer than what thou think'st,' he made reply,
    'A rib there runs from the encircling wall,[627]
    The cruel vales in turn o'erarching high;
  Save that at this 'tis rent and ruined all.
    Ye can climb upward o'er the shattered heap
    Where down the side the piled-up fragments fall.'
  His head bent down a while my Guide did keep,
    Then said: 'He warned us[628] in imperfect wise,               140
    Who sinners with his hook doth clutch and steep.'
  The Friar: 'At Bologna[629] many a vice
    I heard the Devil charged with, and among
    The rest that, false, he father is of lies.'
  Then onward moved my Guide with paces long,
    And some slight shade of anger on his face.
    I with him parted from the burdened throng,
  Stepping where those dear feet had left their trace.


FOOTNOTES:

[610] _Minor Friars_: In the early years of their Order the Franciscans
went in couples upon their journeys, not abreast but one behind the
other.

[611] _Æsop's fable_: This fable, mistakenly attributed to Æsop, tells
of how a frog enticed a mouse into a pond, and how they were then both
devoured by a kite. To discover the aptness of the simile would scarcely
be reward enough for the continued mental effort Dante enjoins. So much
was everything Greek or Roman then held in reverence, that the mention
even of Æsop is held to give dignity to the page.

[612] _Mo_ and _Issa_: Two words for _now_.

[613] _Through us_: The quarrel among the fiends arose from Dante's
insatiable desire to confer with 'Tuscan or Lombard.'

[614] _To the next Bolgia_: The Sixth. They are now on the top of the
circular ridge that divides it from the Fifth. From the construction of
Malebolge the ridge is deeper on the inner side than on that up which
they have travelled from the pitch.

[615] _No more a cause of dread_: There seems some incongruity between
Virgil's dread of these smaller devils and the ease with which he cowed
Minos, Charon, and Pluto. But his character gains in human interest the
more he is represented as sympathising with Dante in his terrors; and in
this particular case the confession of fellow-feeling prepares the way
for the beautiful passage which follows it (line 38, etc.), one full of
an almost modern tenderness.

[616] _Cologne_: Some make it Clugny, the great Benedictine monastery;
but all the old commentators and most of the mss. read Cologne. All that
the text necessarily carries is that the cloaks had great hoods. If, in
addition, a reproach of clumsiness is implied, it would agree well
enough with the Italian estimate of German people and things.

[617] _Frederick's, etc._: The Emperor Frederick II.; but that he used
any torture of leaden sheets seems to be a fabrication of his enemies.

[618] _Passage strait_: Through the crowd of shades, all like themselves
weighed down by the leaden cloaks. There is nothing in all literature
like this picture of the heavily-burdened shades. At first sight it
seems to be little of a torture compared with what we have already seen,
and yet by simple touch after touch an impression is created of the
intolerable weariness of the victims. As always, too, the punishment
answers to the sin. The hypocrites made a fair show in the flesh, and
now their mantles which look like gold are only of base lead. On earth
they were of a sad countenance, trying to seem better than they were,
and the load which to deceive others they voluntarily assumed in life is
now replaced by a still heavier weight, and one they cannot throw off if
they would. The choice of garb conveys an obvious charge of hypocrisy
against the Friars, then greatly fallen away from the purity of their
institution, whether Franciscans or Dominicans.

[619] _An eye askance_: They cannot turn their heads.

[620] _His heaving throat_: In Purgatory Dante is known for a mortal by
his casting a shadow. Here he is known to be of flesh and blood by the
act of respiration; yet, as appears from line 113, the shades, too,
breathe as well as perform other functions of living bodies. At least
they seem so to do, but this is all only in appearance. They only seem
to be flesh and blood, having no weight, casting no shadow, and drawing
breath in a way of their own. Dante, as has been said (_Inf._ vi. 36),
is hard put to it to make them subject to corporal pains and yet be only
shadows.

[621] _Merry Friars_: Knights of the Order of Saint Mary, instituted by
Urban IV. in 1261. Whether the name of Frati Godenti which they here
bear was one of reproach or was simply descriptive of the easy rule
under which they lived, is not known. Married men might, under certain
conditions, enter the Order. The members were to hold themselves aloof
from public office, and were to devote themselves to the defence of the
weak and the promotion of justice and religion. The two monkish
cavaliers of the text were in 1266 brought to Florence as Podestas, the
Pope himself having urged them to go. There is much uncertainty as to
the part they played in Florence, but none as to the fact of their rule
having been highly distasteful to the Florentines, or as to the other
fact, that in Florence they grew wealthy. The Podesta, or chief
magistrate, was always a well-born foreigner. Probably some monkish rule
or custom forbade either Catalano or Loderingo to leave the monastery
singly.

[622] _Gardingo_: A quarter of Florence, in which many palaces were
destroyed about the time of the Podestaship of the Frati.

[623] _One man as victim_: _St. John_ xi. 50. Caiaphas and Annas, with
the Scribes and Pharisees who persecuted Jesus to the death, are the
vilest hypocrites of all. They lie naked across the path, unburdened by
the leaden cloak, it is true, but only that they may feel the more
keenly the weight of the punishment of all the hypocrites of the world.

[624] _Virgil_: On Virgil's earlier journey through Inferno Caiaphas and
the others were not here, and he wonders as at something out of a world
to him unknown.

[625] _On the right_: As they are moving round the Bolgia to the left,
the rocky barrier between them and the Seventh Bolgia is on their right.

[626] _We, both of us_: Dante, still in the body, as well as Virgil, the
shade.

[627] _The encircling wall_: That which encloses all the Malebolge.

[628] _He warned us_: Malacoda (_Inf._ xxi. 109) had assured him that
the next rib of rock ran unbroken across all the Bolgias, but it too,
like all the other bridges, proves to have been, at the time of the
earthquake, shattered where it crossed this gulf of the hypocrites. The
earthquake told most on this Bolgia, because the death of Christ and the
attendant earthquake were, in a sense, caused by the hypocrisy of
Caiaphas and the rest.

[629] _At Bologna_: Even in Inferno the Merry Friar must have his joke.
He is a gentleman, but a bit of a scholar too; and the University of
Bologna is to him what Marischal College was to Captain Dalgetty.




CANTO XXIV.


  In season of the new year, when the sun
    Beneath Aquarius[630] warms again his hair,
    And somewhat on the nights the days have won;
  When on the ground the hoar-frost painteth fair
    A mimic image of her sister white--
    But soon her brush of colour is all bare--
  The clown, whose fodder is consumed outright,
    Rises and looks abroad, and, all the plain
    Beholding glisten, on his thigh doth smite.
  Returned indoors, like wretch that seeks in vain                  10
    What he should do, restless he mourns his case;
    But hope revives when, looking forth again,
  He sees the earth anew has changed its face.
    Then with his crook he doth himself provide,
    And straightway doth his sheep to pasture chase:
  So at my Master was I terrified,
    His brows beholding troubled; nor more slow
    To where I ailed[631] the plaster was applied.
  For when the broken bridge[632] we stood below
    My Guide turned to me with the expression sweet                 20
    Which I beneath the mountain learned to know.
  His arms he opened, after counsel meet
    Held with himself, and, scanning closely o'er
    The fragments first, he raised me from my feet;
  And like a man who, working, looks before,
    With foresight still on that in front bestowed,
    Me to the summit of a block he bore
  And then to me another fragment showed,
    Saying: 'By this thou now must clamber on;
    But try it first if it will bear thy load.'                     30
  The heavy cowled[633] this way could ne'er have gone,
    For hardly we, I holpen, he so light,
    Could clamber up from shattered stone to stone.
  And but that on the inner bank the height
    Of wall is not so great, I say not he,
    But for myself I had been vanquished quite.
  But Malebolge[634] to the cavity
    Of the deep central pit is planned to fall;
    Hence every Bolgia in its turn must be
  High on the out, low on the inner wall;                           40
    So to the summit we attained at last,
    Whence breaks away the topmost stone[635] of all.
  My lungs were so with breathlessness harassed,
    The summit won, I could no further go;
    And, hardly there, me on the ground I cast
  'Well it befits that thou shouldst from thee throw
    All sloth,' the Master said; 'for stretched in down
    Or under awnings none can glory know.
  And he who spends his life nor wins renown
    Leaves in the world no more enduring trace                      50
    Than smoke in air, or foam on water blown.
  Therefore arise; o'ercome thy breathlessness
    By force of will, victor in every fight
    When not subservient to the body base.
  Of stairs thou yet must climb a loftier flight:[636]
    'Tis not enough to have ascended these.
    Up then and profit if thou hear'st aright.'
  Rising I feigned to breathe with greater ease
    Than what I felt, and spake: 'Now forward plod,
    For with my courage now my strength agrees.'                    60
  Up o'er the rocky rib we held our road;
    And rough it was and difficult and strait,
    And steeper far[637] than that we earlier trod.
  Speaking I went, to hide my wearied state,
    When from the neighbouring moat a voice we heard
    Which seemed ill fitted to articulate.
  Of what it said I knew not any word,
    Though on the arch[638] that vaults the moat set high;
    But he who spake appeared by anger stirred.
  Though I bent downward yet my eager eye,                          70
    So dim the depth, explored it all in vain;
    I then: 'O Master, to that bank draw nigh,
  And let us by the wall descent obtain,
    Because I hear and do not understand,
    And looking down distinguish nothing plain.'
  'My sole reply to thee,' he answered bland,
    'Is to perform; for it behoves,' he said,
    'With silent act to answer just demand.'
  Then we descended from the bridge's head,[639]
    Where with the eighth bank is its junction wrought;             80
    And full beneath me was the Bolgia spread.
  And I perceived that hideously 'twas fraught
    With serpents; and such monstrous forms they bore,
    Even now my blood is curdled at the thought.
  Henceforth let sandy Libya boast no more!
    Though she breed hydra, snake that crawls or flies,
    Twy-headed, or fine-speckled, no such store
  Of plagues, nor near so cruel, she supplies,
    Though joined to all the land of Ethiop,
    And that which by the Red Sea waters lies.                      90
  'Midst this fell throng and dismal, without hope
    A naked people ran, aghast with fear--
    No covert for them and no heliotrope.[640]
  Their hands[641] were bound by serpents at their rear,
    Which in their reins for head and tail did get
    A holding-place: in front they knotted were.
  And lo! to one who on our side was set
    A serpent darted forward, him to bite
    At where the neck is by the shoulders met.
  Nor _O_ nor _I_ did any ever write                               100
    More quickly than he kindled, burst in flame,
    And crumbled all to ashes. And when quite
  He on the earth a wasted heap became,
    The ashes[642] of themselves together rolled,
    Resuming suddenly their former frame.
  Thus, as by mighty sages we are told,
    The Phoenix[643] dies, and then is born again,
    When it is close upon five centuries old.
  In all its life it eats not herb nor grain,
    But only tears that from frankincense flow;                    110
    It, for a shroud, sweet nard and myrrh contain.
  And as the man who falls and knows not how,
    By force of demons stretched upon the ground,
    Or by obstruction that makes life run low,
  When risen up straight gazes all around
    In deep confusion through the anguish keen
    He suffered from, and stares with sighs profound:
  So was the sinner, when arisen, seen.
    Justice of God, how are thy terrors piled,
    Showering in vengeance blows thus big with teen!               120
  My Guide then asked of him how he was styled.
    Whereon he said: 'From Tuscany I rained,
    Not long ago, into this gullet wild.
  From bestial life, not human, joy I gained,
    Mule that I was; me, Vanni Fucci,[644] brute,
    Pistoia, fitting den, in life contained.'
  I to my Guide: 'Bid him not budge a foot,
    And ask[645] what crime has plunged him here below.
    In rage and blood I knew him dissolute.'
  The sinner heard, nor insincere did show,                        130
    But towards me turned his face and eke his mind,
    With spiteful shame his features all aglow;
  Then said: 'It pains me more thou shouldst me find
    And catch me steeped in all this misery,
    Than when the other life I left behind.
  What thou demandest I can not deny:
    I'm plunged[646] thus low because the thief I played
    Within the fairly furnished sacristy;
  And falsely to another's charge 'twas laid.
    Lest thou shouldst joy[647] such sight has met thy view
    If e'er these dreary regions thou evade,                       141
  Give ear and hearken to my utterance true:
    The Neri first out of Pistoia fail,
    Her laws and parties Florence shapes anew;
  Mars draws a vapour out of Magra's vale,
    Which black and threatening clouds accompany:
    Then bursting in a tempest terrible
  Upon Piceno shall the war run high;
    The mist by it shall suddenly be rent,
    And every Bianco[648] smitten be thereby:                      150
  And I have told thee that thou mayst lament.'


FOOTNOTES:

[630] _Aquarius_: The sun is in the constellation of Aquarius from the
end of January till the end of February; and already, say in the middle
of February, the day is nearly as long as the night.

[631] _Where I ailed, etc._: As the peasant is in despair at seeing the
earth white with what he thinks is snow, so was Dante at the signs of
trouble on Virgil's face. He has mistaken anger at the cheat for
perplexity as to how they are to escape from the Bolgia; and his
Master's smile is grateful and reassuring to him as the spectacle of the
green earth to the despairing shepherd.

[632] _The broken bridge_: They are about to escape from the bottom of
the Sixth Bolgia by climbing the wall between it and the Seventh, at the
point where the confused fragments of the bridge Friar Catalano told
them of (_Inf._ xxiii. 133) lie piled up against the wall, and yield
something of a practicable way.

[633] _The heavy cowled_: He finds his illustration on the spot, his
mind being still full of the grievously burdened hypocrites.

[634] _But Malebolge, etc._: Each Bolgia in turn lies at a lower level
than the one before it, and consequently the inner side of each dividing
ridge or wall is higher than the outer; or, to put it otherwise, in each
Bolgia the wall they come to last--that nearest the centre of the
Inferno, is lower than that they first reach--the one enclosing the
Bolgia.

[635] _The topmost stone_: The stone that had formed the beginning of
the arch at this end of it.

[636] _A loftier flight_: When he ascends the Mount of Purgatory.

[637] _Steeper far, etc._: Rougher and steeper than the rib of rock they
followed till they had crossed the Fifth Bolgia. They are now travelling
along a different spoke of the wheel.

[638] _The arch, etc._: He has gone on hiding his weariness till he is
on the top of the arch that overhangs the Seventh Bolgia--that in which
thieves are punished.

[639] _Front the bridge's head_: Further on they climb up again (_Inf._
xxvi. 13) by the projecting stones which now supply them with the means
of descent. It is a disputed point how far they do descend. Clearly it
is further than merely from the bridge to the lower level of the wall
dividing the Seventh from the Eighth Bolgia; but not so far as to the
ground of the moat. Most likely the stones jut forth at the angle formed
by the junction of the bridge and the rocky wall. On one of the lowest
of these they find a standing-place whence they can see clearly what is
in the Bolgia.

[640] _Heliotrope_: A stone supposed to make the bearer of it invisible.

[641] _Their hands, etc._: The sinners in this Bolgia are the thieves,
not the violent robbers and highwaymen but those crime involves a
betrayal of trust. After all their cunning thefts they are naked now;
and, though here is nothing to steal, hands are firmly bound behind
them.

[642] _The ashes, etc._: The sufferings of the thieves, if looked
closely into, will be found appropriate to their sins. They would fain
but cannot steal themselves away, and in addition to the constant terror
of being found out they are subject to pains the essence of which
consists in the deprivation--the theft from them--of their unsubstantial
bodies, which are all that they now have to lose. In the case of this
victim the deprivation is only temporary.

[643] _The Phoenix_: Dante here borrows very directly from Ovid
(_Metam._ xv.).

[644] _Vanni Fucci_: Natural son of a Pistoiese noble and a poet of some
merit, who bore a leading part in the ruthless feuds of Blacks and
Whites which distracted Pistoia towards the close of the thirteenth
century.

[645] _And ask, etc._: Dante wishes to find out why Fucci is placed
among the thieves, and not in the circle of the violent. The question is
framed so as to compel confession of a crime for which the sinner had
not been condemned in life; and he flushes with rage at being found
among the cowardly thieves.

[646] _I'm plunged, etc._: Fucci was concerned in the theft of treasure
from the Cathedral Church of St. James at Pistoia. Accounts vary as to
the circumstances under which the crime was committed, and as to who
suffered for it. Neither is it certainly known when Fucci died, though
his recent arrival in the Bolgia agrees with the view that he was still
active on the side of the Blacks in the last year of the century. In the
fierceness of his retort to Dante we have evidence of their old
acquaintance and old enmity.

[647] _Lest thou shouldst joy_: Vanni, a _Nero_ or Black, takes his
revenge for being found here by Dante, who was, as he knew, associated
with the _Bianchi_ or Whites, by prophesying an event full of disaster
to these.

[648] _Every Bianco, etc._: The Blacks, according to Villani (viii. 45),
were driven from Pistoia in May 1301. They took refuge in Florence,
where their party, in the following November under the protection of
Charles of Valois, finally gained the upper hand, and began to persecute
and expel the Whites, among whom was Dante. Mars, the god of war, or,
more probably, the planet of war, draws a vapour from the valley of the
Magra, a small stream which flows into the Mediterranean on the northern
confine of Tuscany. This vapour is said to signify Moroello Malaspina, a
noble of that district and an active leader of the Blacks, who here
figure as murky clouds. The Campo Piceno is the country west of Pistoia.
There Moroello bursts on his foes like a lightning-flash out of its
cloud. This seems to refer to a pitched battle that should have happened
soon after the Blacks recovered their strength; but the chroniclers tell
of none such, though some of the commentators do. The fortress of
Seravalle was taken from the Pistoiese, it is true, in 1302, and
Moroello is said to have been the leader of the force which starved it
into submission. He was certainly present at the great siege of Pistoia
in 1305, when the citizens suffered the last rigours of famine.--This
prophecy by Fucci recalls those by Farinata and Ciacco.




CANTO XXV.


  The robber,[649] when his words were ended so,
    Made both the figs and lifted either fist,
    Shouting: 'There, God! for them at thee I throw.'
  Then were the snakes my friends; for one 'gan twist
    And coiled itself around the sinner's throat,
    As if to say: 'Now would I have thee whist.'
  Another seized his arms and made a knot,
    Clinching itself upon them in such wise
    He had no power to move them by a jot.
  Pistoia![650] thou, Pistoia, shouldst devise                      10
    To burn thyself to ashes, since thou hast
    Outrun thy founders in iniquities.
  The blackest depths of Hell through which I passed
    Showed me no soul 'gainst God so filled with spite,
    No, not even he who down Thebes' wall[651] was cast.
  He spake no further word, but turned to flight;
    And I beheld a Centaur raging sore
    Come shouting: 'Of the ribald give me sight!'
  I scarce believe Maremma[652] yieldeth more
    Snakes of all kinds than what composed the load                 20
    Which on his back, far as our form, he bore.
  Behind his nape, with pinions spread abroad,
    A dragon couchant on his shoulders lay
    To set on fire whoever bars his road.
  'This one is Cacus,'[653] did my Master say,
    'Who underneath the rock of Aventine
    Watered a pool with blood day after day.
  Not with his brethren[654] runs he in the line,
    Because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought
    Upon the neighbouring wealthy herd of kine:                     30
  Whence to his crooked course an end was brought
    'Neath Hercules' club, which on him might shower down
    A hundred blows; ere ten he suffered nought.'
  While this he said, the other had passed on;
    And under us three spirits forward pressed
    Of whom my Guide and I had nothing known
  But that: 'Who are ye?' they made loud request.
    Whereon our tale[655] no further could proceed;
    And toward them wholly we our wits addressed.
  I recognised them not, but gave good heed;                        40
    Till, as it often haps in such a case,
    To name another, one discovered need,
  Saying: 'Now where stopped Cianfa[656] in the race?'
    Then, that my Guide might halt and hearken well,
    On chin[657] and nose I did my finger place.
  If, Reader, to believe what now I tell
    Thou shouldst be slow, I wonder not, for I
    Who saw it all scarce find it credible.
  While I on them my brows kept lifted high
    A serpent, which had six feet, suddenly flew                    50
    At one of them and held him bodily.
  Its middle feet about his paunch it drew,
    And with the two in front his arms clutched fast,
    And bit one cheek and the other through and through.
  Its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast,
    Thrusting its tail between them till behind,
    Distended o'er his reins, it upward passed.
  The ivy to a tree could never bind
    Itself so firmly as this dreadful beast
    Its members with the other's intertwined.                       60
  Each lost the colour that it once possessed,
    And closely they, like heated wax, unite,
    The former hue of neither manifest:
  Even so up o'er papyrus,[658] when alight,
    Before the flame there spreads a colour dun,
    Not black as yet, though from it dies the white.
  The other two meanwhile were looking on,
    Crying: 'Agnello, how art thou made new!
    Thou art not twain, and yet no longer one.'
  A single head was moulded out of two;                             70
    And on our sight a single face arose,
    Which out of both lost countenances grew.
  Four separate limbs did but two arms compose;
    Belly with chest, and legs with thighs did grow
    To members such as nought created shows.
  Their former fashion was all perished now:
    The perverse shape did both, yet neither seem;
    And, thus transformed, departed moving slow.
  And as the lizard, which at fierce extreme
    Of dog-day heat another hedge would gain,                       80
    Flits 'cross the path swift as the lightning's gleam;
  Right for the bellies of the other twain
    A little snake[659] quivering with anger sped,
    Livid and black as is a pepper grain,
  And on the part by which we first are fed
    Pierced one of them; and then upon the ground
    It fell before him, and remained outspread.
  The wounded gazed on it, but made no sound.
    Rooted he stood[660] and yawning, scarce awake,
    As seized by fever or by sleep profound.                        90
  It closely watched him and he watched the snake,
    While from its mouth and from his wound 'gan swell
    Volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make.
  Be Lucan henceforth dumb, nor longer tell
    Of plagued Sabellus and Nassidius,[661]
    But, hearkening to what follows, mark it well.
  Silent be Ovid: of him telling us
    How Cadmus[662] to a snake, and to a fount
    Changed Arethuse,[663] I am not envious;
  For never of two natures front to front                          100
    In metamorphosis, while mutually
    The forms[664] their matter changed, he gives account.
  'Twas thus that each to the other made reply:
    Its tail into a fork the serpent split;
    Bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh:
  And then in one so thoroughly were knit
    His legs and thighs, no searching could divine
    At where the junction had been wrought in it.
  The shape, of which the one lost every sign,
    The cloven tail was taking; then the skin                      110
    Of one grew rough, the other's soft and fine.
  I by the armpits saw the arms drawn in;
    And now the monster's feet, which had been small,
    What the other's lost in length appeared to win.
  Together twisted, its hind feet did fall
    And grew the member men are used to hide:
    For his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl.
  Dyed in the smoke they took on either side
    A novel colour: hair unwonted grew
    On one; the hair upon the other died.                          120
  The one fell prone, erect the other drew,
    With cruel eyes continuing to glare,
    'Neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew.
  The erect to his brows drew his. Of stuff to spare
    Of what he upward pulled, there was no lack;
    So ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare.
  Of that which clung in front nor was drawn back,
    Superfluous, on the face was formed a nose,
    And lips absorbed the skin that still was slack.
  His muzzle who lay prone now forward goes;                       130
    Backward into his head his ears he draws
    Even as a snail appears its horns to lose.
  The tongue, which had been whole and ready was
    For speech, cleaves now; the forked tongue of the snake
    Joins in the other: and the smoke has pause.[665]
  The soul which thus a brutish form did take,
    Along the valley, hissing, swiftly fled;
    The other close behind it spluttering spake,
  Then, toward it turning his new shoulders, said
    Unto the third: 'Now Buoso down the way                        140
    May hasten crawling, as I earlier sped.'
  Ballast which in the Seventh Bolgia lay
    Thus saw I shift and change. Be my excuse
    The novel theme,[666] if swerves my pen astray.
  And though these things mine eyesight might confuse
    A little, and my mind with fear divide,
    Such secrecy they fleeing could not use
  But that Puccio Sciancatto plain I spied;
    And he alone of the companions three
    Who came at first, was left unmodified.                        150
  For the other, tears, Gaville,[667] are shed by thee.


FOOTNOTES:

[649] _The robber, etc._: By means of his prophecy Fucci has, after a
fashion, taken revenge on Dante for being found by him among the
cheating thieves instead of among the nobler sinners guilty of blood and
violence. But in the rage of his wounded pride he must insult even
Heaven, and this he does by using the most contemptuous gesture in an
Italian's repertory. The fig is made by thrusting the thumb between the
next two fingers. In the English 'A fig for him!' we have a reference to
the gesture.

[650] _Pistoia_: The Pistoiese bore the reputation of being hard and
pitiless. The tradition was that their city had been founded by such of
Catiline's followers as survived his defeat on the Campo Piceno. 'It is
no wonder,' says Villani (i. 32) 'that, being the descendants as they
are of Catiline and his followers, the Pistoiese have always been
ruthless and cruel to strangers and to one another.'

[651] _Who down Thebes' wall_: Capaneus (_Inf._ xiv. 63).

[652] _Maremma_: See note, _Inf._ xiii. 8.

[653] _Cacus_: Dante makes him a Centaur, but Virgil (_Æn._ viii.) only
describes him as half human. The pool was fed with the blood of his
human victims. The herd was the spoil Hercules took from Geryon. In the
_Æneid_ Cacus defends himself from Hercules by vomiting a fiery smoke;
and this doubtless suggested the dragon of the text.

[654] _His brethren_: The Centaurs who guard the river of blood (_Inf._
xii. 56). In Fucci, as a sinner guilty of blood and violence above most
of the thieves, the Centaur Cacus takes a special malign interest.

[655] _Our tale_: Of Cacus. It is interrupted by the arrival of three
sinners whom Dante does not at first recognise as he gazes down on them,
but only when they begin to speak among themselves. They are three noble
citizens of Florence: Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso degli Abati, and
Puccio Sciancatto de' Galigai--all said to have pilfered in private
life, or to have abused their tenure of high office by plundering the
Commonwealth. What is certainly known of them is that they were
Florentine thieves of quality.

[656] _Cianfa_: Another Florentine gentleman, one of the Donati. Since
his companions lost sight of him he has been transformed into a
six-footed serpent. Immediately appearing, he darts upon Agnello.

[657] _On chin, etc._: A gesture by which silence is requested. The
mention of Cianfa shows Dante that he is among Florentines.

[658] _Papyrus_: The original is _papiro_, the word used in Dante's time
for a wick made out of a reed like the papyrus; _papér_ being still the
name for a wick in some dialects.--(Scartazzini.) It cannot be shown
that _papiro_ was ever employed for paper in Italian. This, however,
does not prove that Dante may not so use it in this instance, adopting
it from the Latin _papyrus_. Besides, he says that the brown colour
travels up over the _papiro_; while it goes downward on a burning wick.
Nor would the simile, if drawn from a slowly burning lamp-wick, agree
with the speed of the change described in the text.

[659] _A little snake_: As transpires from the last line of the Canto,
this is Francesco, of the Florentine family of the Cavalcanti, to which
Dante's friend Guido belonged. He wounds Buoso in the navel, and then,
instead of growing into one new monster as was the case with Cianfa and
Agnello, they exchange shapes, and when the transformation is complete
Buoso is the serpent and Francesco is the human shade.

[660] _Rooted he stood, etc._: The description agrees with the symptoms
of snake-bite, one of which is extreme drowsiness.

[661] _Sabellus and Nassidius_: Were soldiers of Cato's army whose death
by snake-bite in the Libyan desert is described by Lucan, _Pharsal._ ix.
Sabbellus was burned up by the poison, bones and all; Nassidius swelled
up and burst.

[662] _Cadmus_: _Metam._ iv.

[663] _Arethusa_: _Metam._ v.

[664] _The forms, etc._: The word _form_ is here to be taken in its
scholastic sense of _virtus formativa_, the inherited power of modifying
matter into an organised body. 'This, united to the divinely implanted
spark of reason,' says Philalethes, 'constitutes, on Dante's system, a
human soul. Even after death this power continues to be an essential
constituent of the soul, and constructs out of the elements what seems
to be a body. Here the sinners exchange the matter they have thus made
their own, each retaining, however, his proper plastic energy as part of
his soul.' Dante in his _Convito_ (iii. 2) says that 'the human soul is
the noblest form of all that are made under the heavens, receiving more
of the Divine nature than any other.'

[665] _The smoke has pause_: The sinners have robbed one another of all
they can lose. In the punishment is mirrored the sin that plunged them
here.

[666] _The novel theme_: He has lingered longer than usual on this
Bolgia, and pleads wonder of what he saw in excuse either of his
prolixity or of some of the details of his description. The expression
is perhaps one of feigned humility, to balance his recent boast of
excelling Ovid and Lucan in inventive power.

[667] _Gaville_: The other, and the only one of those five Florentine
thieves not yet named in the text, is he who came at first in the form
of a little black snake, and who has now assumed the shape of Buoso. In
reality he is Francesco Cavalcanti, who was slain by the people of
Gaville in the upper Valdarno. Many of them were in their turn
slaughtered in revenge by the Cavalcanti and their associates. It should
be remarked that some of these five Florentines were of one party, some
of the other. It is also noteworthy that Dante recruits his thieves as
he did his usurers from the great Florentine families.--As the 'shifting
and changing' of this rubbish is apt to be found confusing, the
following may be useful to some readers:--There first came on the scene
Agnello, Buoso, and Puccio. Cianfa, in the shape of a six-footed
serpent, comes and throws himself on Agnello, and then, grown
incorporate in a new strange monster, two in one, they disappear. Buoso
is next wounded by Francesco, and they exchange members and bodies. Only
Puccio remains unchanged.




CANTO XXVI.


  Rejoice, O Florence, in thy widening fame!
    Thy wings thou beatest over land and sea,
    And even through Inferno spreads thy name.
  Burghers of thine, five such were found by me
    Among the thieves; whence I ashamed[668] grew,
    Nor shall great glory thence redound to thee.
  But if 'tis toward the morning[669] dreams are true,
    Thou shalt experience ere long time be gone
    The doom even Prato[670] prays for as thy due.
  And came it now, it would not come too soon.                      10
    Would it were come as come it must with time:
    'Twill crush me more the older I am grown.
  Departing thence, my Guide began to climb
    The jutting rocks by which we made descent
    Some while ago,[671] and pulled me after him.
  And as upon our lonely way we went
    'Mong splinters[672] of the cliff, the feet in vain,
    Without the hand to help, had labour spent.
  I sorrowed, and am sorrow-smit again,
    Recalling what before mine eyes there lay,                      20
    And, more than I am wont, my genius rein
  From running save where virtue leads the way;
    So that if happy star[673] or holier might
    Have gifted me I never mourn it may.
  At time of year when he who gives earth light
    His face shows to us longest visible,
    When gnats replace the fly at fall of night,
  Not by the peasant resting on the hill
    Are seen more fire-flies in the vale below,
    Where he perchance doth field and vineyard[674] till,           30
  Than flamelets I beheld resplendent glow
    Throughout the whole Eighth Bolgia, when at last
    I stood whence I the bottom plain could know.
  And as he whom the bears avenged, when passed
    From the earth Elijah, saw the chariot rise
    With horses heavenward reared and mounting fast,
  And no long time had traced it with his eyes
    Till but a flash of light it all became,
    Which like a rack of cloud swept to the skies:
  Deep in the valley's gorge, in mode the same,                     40
    These flitted; what it held by none was shown,
    And yet a sinner[675] lurked in every flame.
  To see them well I from the bridge peered down,
    And if a jutting crag I had not caught
    I must have fallen, though neither thrust nor thrown.
  My Leader me beholding lost in thought:
    'In all the fires are spirits,' said to me;
    'His flame round each is for a garment wrought.'
  'O Master!' I replied, 'by hearing thee
    I grow assured, but yet I knew before                           50
    That thus indeed it was, and longed to be
  Told who is in the flame which there doth soar,
    Cloven, as if ascending from the pyre
    Where with Eteocles[676] there burned of yore
  His brother.' He: 'Ulysses in that fire
    And Diomedes[677] burn; in punishment
    Thus held together, as they held in ire.
  And, wrapped within their flame, they now repent
    The ambush of the horse, which oped the door
    Through which the Romans' noble seed[678] forth went.           60
  For guile Deïdamia[679] makes deplore
    In death her lost Achilles, tears they shed,
    And bear for the Palladium[680] vengeance sore.'
  'Master, I pray thee fervently,' I said,
    'If from those flames they still can utter speech--
    Give ear as if a thousand times I pled!
  Refuse not here to linger, I beseech,
    Until the cloven fire shall hither gain:
    Thou seest how toward it eagerly I reach.'
  And he: 'Thy prayers are worthy to obtain                         70
    Exceeding praise; thou hast what thou dost seek:
    But see that thou from speech thy tongue refrain.
  I know what thou wouldst have; leave me to speak,
    For they perchance would hear contemptuously
    Shouldst thou address them, seeing they were Greek.'[681]
  Soon as the flame toward us had come so nigh
    That to my Leader time and place seemed met,
    I heard him thus adjure it to reply:
  'O ye who twain within one fire are set,
    If what I did your guerdon meriteth,                            80
    If much or little ye are in my debt
  For the great verse I built while I had breath,
    By one of you be openly confessed
    Where, lost to men, at last he met with death.'
  Of the ancient flame the more conspicuous crest
    Murmuring began to waver up and down
    Like flame that flickers, by the wind distressed.
  At length by it was measured motion shown,
    Like tongue that moves in speech; and by the flame
    Was language uttered thus: 'When I had gone                     90
  From Circe[682] who a long year kept me tame
    Beside her, ere the near Gaeta had
    Receivèd from Æneas that new name;
  No softness for my son, nor reverence sad
    For my old father, nor the love I owed
    Penelope with which to make her glad,
  Could quench the ardour that within me glowed
    A full experience of the world to gain--
    Of human vice and worth. But I abroad
  Launched out upon the high and open main[683]                    100
    With but one bark and but the little band
    Which ne'er deserted me.[684] As far as Spain
  I saw the sea-shore upon either hand,
    And as Morocco; saw Sardinia's isle,
    And all of which those waters wash the strand.
  I and my comrades were grown old the while
    And sluggish, ere we to the narrows came
    Where Hercules of old did landmarks pile
  For sign to men they should no further aim;
    And Seville lay behind me on the right,                        110
    As on the left lay Ceuta. Then to them
  I spake: "O Brothers, who through such a fight
    Of hundred thousand dangers West have won,
    In this short watch that ushers in the night
  Of all your senses, ere your day be done,
    Refuse not to obtain experience new
    Of worlds unpeopled, yonder, past the sun.
  Consider whence the seed of life ye drew;
    Ye were not born to live like brutish herd,
    But righteousness and wisdom to ensue."                        120
  My comrades to such eagerness were stirred
    By this short speech the course to enter on,
    They had no longer brooked restraining word.
  Turning our poop to where the morning shone
    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
    Still tending left the further we had gone.
  And of the other pole I saw at night
    Now all the stars; and 'neath the watery plain
    Our own familiar heavens were lost to sight.
  Five times afresh had kindled, and again                         130
    The moon's face earthward was illumed no more,
    Since out we sailed upon the mighty main;[685]
  Then we beheld a lofty mountain[686] soar,
    Dim in the distance; higher, as I thought,
    By far than any I had seen before.
  We joyed; but with despair were soon distraught
    When burst a whirlwind from the new-found world
    And the forequarter of the vessel caught.
  With all the waters thrice it round was swirled;
    At the fourth time the poop, heaved upward, rose,              140
    The prow, as pleased Another,[687] down was hurled;
  And then above us did the ocean close.'


FOOTNOTES:

[668] _Whence I ashamed, etc._: There is here a sudden change from irony
to earnest. 'Five members of great Florentine families, eternally
engaged among themselves in their shameful metamorphoses--nay, but it is
too sad!'

[669] _Toward the morning, etc._: There was a widespread belief in the
greater truthfulness of dreams dreamed as the night wears away. See
_Purg._ ix. 13. The dream is Dante's foreboding of what is to happen to
Florence. Of its truth he has no doubt, and the only question is how
soon will it be answered by the fact. Soon, he says, if it is near to
the morning that we dream true dreams--morning being the season of
waking reality in which dreams are accomplished.

[670] _Even Prato_: A small neighbouring city, much under the influence
of Florence, and somewhat oppressed by it. The commentators reckon up
the disasters that afflicted Florence in the first years of the
fourteenth century, between the date of Dante's journey and the time he
wrote--fires, falls of bridges, and civil strife. But such misfortunes
were too much in keeping with the usual course of Florentine history to
move Dante thus deeply in the retrospect; and as he speaks here in his
own person the 'soon' is more naturally counted from the time at which
he writes than from the date assigned by him to his pilgrimage. He is
looking forward to the period when his own return in triumph to Florence
was to be prepared by grievous national reverses; and, as a patriot, he
feels that he cannot be wholly reconciled by his private advantage to
the public misfortune. But it was all only a dream.

[671] _Some while ago_: See note, _Inf._ xxiv. 79.

[672] _'Mong splinters, etc._: They cross the wall or barrier between
the Seventh and Eighth Bolgias. From _Inf._ xxiv. 63 we have learned
that the rib of rock, on the line of which they are now proceeding, with
its arches which overhang the various Bolgias, is rougher and worse to
follow than that by which they began their passage towards the centre of
Malebolge.

[673] _Happy star_: See note, _Inf._ xv. 55. Dante seems to have been
uncertain what credence to give to the claims of astrology. In a passage
of the _Purgatorio_ (xvi. 67) he tries to establish that whatever
influence the stars may possess over us we can never, except with our
own consent, be influenced by them to evil.--His sorrow here, as
elsewhere, is not wholly a feeling of pity for the suffering shades, but
is largely mingled with misgivings for himself. The punishment of those
to whose sins he feels no inclination he always beholds with equanimity.
Here, as he looks down upon the false counsellors and considers what
temptations there are to misapply intellectual gifts, he is smitten with
dread lest his lot should one day be cast in that dismal valley and he
find cause to regret that the talent of genius was ever committed to
him. The memory even of what he saw makes him recollect himself and
resolve to be wary. Then, as if to justify the claim to superior powers
thus clearly implied, there comes a passage which in the original is of
uncommon beauty.

[674] _Field and vineyard_: These lines, redolent of the sweet Tuscan
midsummer gloaming, give us amid the horrors of Malebolge something like
the breath of fresh air the peasant lingers to enjoy. It may be noted
that in Italy the village is often found perched above the more fertile
land, on a site originally chosen with a view to security from attack.
So that here the peasant is at home from his labour.

[675] _And yet a sinner, etc._: The false counsellors who for selfish
ends hid their true minds and misused their intellectual light to lead
others astray are for ever hidden each in his own wandering flame.

[676] _Eteocles_: Son of Oedipus and twin brother of Polynices. The
brothers slew one another, and were placed on the same funeral pile, the
flame of which clove into two as if to image the discord that had
existed between them (_Theb._ xii.).

[677] _And Diomedes_: The two are associated in deeds of blood and guile
at the siege of Troy.

[678] _The Romans' noble seed_: The trick of the wooden horse led to the
capture of Troy, and that led Æneas to wander forth on the adventures
that ended in the settlement of the Trojans in Italy.

[679] _Deïdamia_: That Achilles might be kept from joining the Greek
expedition to Troy he was sent by his mother to the court of Lycomedes,
father of Deïdamia. Ulysses lured him away from his hiding-place and
from Deïdamia, whom he had made a mother.

[680] _The Palladium_: The Trojan sacred image of Pallas, stolen by
Ulysses and Diomed (_Æn._ ii.). Ulysses is here upon his own ground.

[681] _They were Greek_: Some find here an allusion to Dante's ignorance
of the Greek language and literature. But Virgil addresses them in the
Lombard dialect of Italian (_Inf._ xxvii. 21). He acts as spokesman
because those ancient Greeks were all so haughty that to a common modern
mortal they would have nothing to say. He, as the author of the _Æneid_,
has a special claim on their good-nature. It is but seldom that the
shades are told who Virgil is, and never directly. Here Ulysses may
infer it from the mention of the 'lofty verse.'

[682] _From Circe_: It is Ulysses that speaks.

[683] _The open main_: The Mediterranean as distinguished from the
Ægean.

[684] _Which ne'er deserted me_: There seems no reason for supposing,
with Philalethes, that Ulysses is here represented as sailing on his
last voyage from the island of Circe and not from Ithaca. Ulysses, on
the contrary, represents himself as breaking away afresh from all the
ties of home. According to Homer, Ulysses had lost all his companions
ere he returned to Ithaca; and in the _Odyssey_ Tiresias prophesies to
him that his last wanderings are to be inland. But any acquaintance that
Dante had with Homer can only have been vague and fragmentary. He may
have founded his narrative of how Ulysses ended his days upon some
floating legend; or, eager to fill up what he took to be a blank in the
world of imagination, he may have drawn wholly on his own creative
power. In any case it is his Ulysses who, through the version of him
given by a living poet, is most familiar to the English reader.

[685] _The mighty main_: The Atlantic Ocean. They bear to the left as
they sail, till their course is due south, and crossing the Equator,
they find themselves under the strange skies of the southern hemisphere.
For months they have seen no land.

[686] _A lofty mountain_: This is the Mountain of Purgatory, according
to Dante's geography antipodal to Jerusalem, and the only land in the
southern hemisphere.

[687] _As pleased Another_: Ulysses is proudly resigned to the failure
of his enterprise, 'for he was Greek.'




CANTO XXVII.


  Now, having first erect and silent grown
    (For it would say no more), from us the flame,
    The Poet sweet consenting,[688] had moved on;
  And then our eyes were turned to one that came[689]
    Behind it on the way, by sounds that burst
    Out of its crest in a confusèd stream.
  As the Sicilian bull,[690] which bellowed first
    With his lamenting--and it was but right--
    Who had prepared it with his tools accurst,[691]
  Roared with the howlings of the tortured wight,                   10
    So that although constructed all of brass
    Yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height;
  So, wanting road and vent by which to pass
    Up through the flame, into the flame's own speech
    The woeful language all converted was.
  But when the words at length contrived to reach
    The top, while hither thither shook the crest
    As moved the tongue[692] at utterance of each,
  We heard: 'Oh thou, to whom are now addressed
    My words, who spakest now in Lombard phrase:                    20
    "Depart;[693] of thee I nothing more request."
  Though I be late arrived, yet of thy grace
    Let it not irk thee here a while to stay:
    It irks not me, yet, as thou seest, I blaze.
  If lately to this world devoid of day
    From that sweet Latian land thou art come down
    Whence all my guilt I bring, declare and say
  Has now Romagna peace? because my own
    Native abode was in the mountain land
    'Tween springs[694] of Tiber and Urbino town.'                  30
  While I intent and bending low did stand,
    My Leader, as he touched me on the side,
    'Speak thou, for he is Latian,' gave command.
  Whereon without delay I thus replied--
    Because already[695] was my speech prepared:
    'Soul, that down there dost in concealment 'bide,
  In thy Romagna[696] wars have never spared
    And spare not now in tyrants' hearts to rage;
    But when I left it there was none declared.
  No change has fallen Ravenna[697] for an age.                     40
    There, covering Cervia too with outspread wing,
    Polenta's Eagle guards his heritage.
  Over the city[698] which long suffering
    Endured, and Frenchmen slain on Frenchmen rolled,
    The Green Paws[699] once again protection fling.
  The Mastiffs of Verrucchio,[700] young and old,
    Who to Montagna[701] brought such evil cheer,
    Still clinch their fangs where they were wont to hold.
  Cities,[702] Lamone and Santerno near,
    The Lion couched in white are governed by                       50
    Which changes party with the changing year.
  And that to which the Savio[703] wanders nigh
    As it is set 'twixt mountain and champaign
    Lives now in freedom now 'neath tyranny.
  But who thou art I to be told am fain:
    Be not more stubborn than we others found,
    As thou on earth illustrious wouldst remain.'
  When first the fire a little while had moaned
    After its manner, next the pointed crest
    Waved to and fro; then in this sense breathed sound:
  'If I believed my answer were addressed                           61
    To one that earthward shall his course retrace,
    This flame should forthwith altogether rest.
  But since[704] none ever yet out of this place
    Returned alive, if all be true I hear,
    I yield thee answer fearless of disgrace.
  I was a warrior, then a Cordelier;[705]
    Thinking thus girt to purge away my stain:
    And sure my hope had met with answer clear
  Had not the High Priest[706]--ill with him remain!                70
    Plunged me anew into my former sin:
    And why and how, I would to thee make plain.
  While I the frame of bones and flesh was in
    My mother gave me, all the deeds I wrought
    Were fox-like and in no wise leonine.
  Of every wile and hidden way I caught
    The secret trick, and used them with such sleight
    That all the world with fame of it was fraught.
  When I perceived I had attainèd quite
    The time of life when it behoves each one                       80
    To furl his sails and coil his cordage tight,
  Sorrowing for deeds I had with pleasure done,
    Contrite and shriven, I religious grew.
    Ah, wretched me! and well it was begun
  But for the Chieftain of the Pharisees new,[707]
    Then waging war hard by the Lateran,
    And not with Saracen nor yet with Jew;
  For Christian[708] were his enemies every man,
    And none had at the siege of Acre been
    Or trafficked in the Empire of Soldàn.                          90
  His lofty office he held cheap, and e'en
    His Sacred Orders and the cord I wore,
    Which used[709] to make the wearers of it lean.
  As from Soracte[710] Constantine of yore
    Sylvester called to cure his leprosy,
    I as a leech was called this man before
  To cure him of his fever which ran high;
    My counsel he required, but I stood dumb,
    For drunken all his words appeared to be.
  He said; "For fear be in thy heart no room;                      100
    Beforehand I absolve thee, but declare
    How Palestrina I may overcome.
  Heaven I unlock, as thou art well aware,
    And close at will; because the keys are twin
    My predecessor[711] was averse to bear."
  Then did his weighty reasoning on me win
    Till to be silent seemed the worst of all;
    And, "Father," I replied, "since from this sin
  Thou dost absolve me into which I fall--
    The scant performance[712] of a promise wide                   110
    Will yield thee triumph in thy lofty stall."
  Francis came for me soon as e'er I died;
    But one of the black Cherubim was there
    And "Take him not, nor rob me of him" cried,
  "For him of right among my thralls I bear
    Because he offered counsel fraudulent;
    Since when I've had him firmly by the hair.
  None is absolved unless he first repent;
    Nor can repentance house with purpose ill,
    For this the contradiction doth prevent."                      120
  Ah, wretched me! How did I shrinking thrill
    When clutching me he sneered: "Perhaps of old
    Thou didst not think[713] I had in logic skill."
  He carried me to Minos:[714] Minos rolled
    His tail eight times round his hard back; in ire
    Biting it fiercely, ere of me he told:
  "Among the sinners of the shrouding fire!"
    Therefore am I, where thou beholdest, lost;
    And, sore at heart, go clothed in such attire.'
  What he would say thus ended by the ghost,                       130
    Away from us the moaning flame did glide
    While to and fro its pointed horn was tossed.
  But we passed further on, I and my Guide,
    Along the cliff to where the arch is set
    O'er the next moat, where paying they reside,
  As schismatics who whelmed themselves in debt.


FOOTNOTES:

[688] _Consenting_: See line 21.

[689] _One that came_: This is the fire-enveloped shade of Guido of
Montefeltro, the colloquy with whom occupies the whole of the Canto.

[690] _The Sicilian bull_: Perillus, an Athenian, presented Phalaris,
the tyrant of Agrigentum, with a brazen bull so constructed that when it
was heated from below the cries of the victim it contained were
converted into the bellowing of a bull. The first trial of the invention
was made upon the artist.

[691] _Accurst_: Not in the original. 'Rime in English hath such
scarcity,' as Chaucer says.

[692] _As moved the tongue, etc._: The shade being enclosed in the
hollow fire all his words are changed into a sound like the roaring of a
flame. At last, when an opening has been worked through the crested
point, the speech becomes articulate.

[693] _Depart, etc._: One at least of the words quoted as having been
used by Virgil is Lombard. There is something very quaint in making him
use the Lombard dialect of Dante's time.

[694] _'Tween springs, etc._: Montefeltro lies between Urbino and the
mountain where the Tiber has its source.

[695] _Already_: Dante knew that Virgil would refer to him for an answer
to Guido's question, bearing as it did on modern Italian affairs.

[696] _Romagna_: The district of Italy lying on the Adriatic, south of
the Po and east of Tuscany, of which Bologna and the cities named in the
text were the principal towns. During the last quarter of the thirteenth
century it was the scene of constant wars promoted in the interest of
the Church, which claimed Romagna as the gift of the Emperor Rudolf, and
in that of the great nobles of the district, who while using the Guelf
and Ghibeline war-cries aimed at nothing but the lordship of the various
cities. Foremost among these nobles was he with whose shade Dante
speaks. Villani calls him 'the most sagacious and accomplished warrior
of his time in Italy' (_Cronica_, vii. 80). He was possessed of lands of
his own near Forlì and Cesena, and was lord in turn of many of the
Romagnese cities. On the whole he appears to have remained true to his
Ghibeline colours in spite of Papal fulminations, although once and
again he was reconciled to the Church; on the last occasion in 1294. In
the years immediately before this he had greatly distinguished himself
as a wise governor and able general in the service of the Ghibeline
Pisa--or rather as the paid lord of it.

[697] _Ravenna_: Ravenna and the neighbouring town of Cervia were in
1300 under the lordship of members of the Polenta family--the father and
brothers of the ill-fated Francesca (_Inf._ v.). Their arms were an
eagle, half white on an azure and half red on a gold field. It was in
the court of the generous Guido, son of one of these brothers, that
Dante was to find his last refuge and to die.

[698] _Over the city, etc._: Forlì. The reference is to one of the most
brilliant feats of war performed by Guido of Montefeltro. Frenchmen
formed great part of an army sent in 1282 against Forlì by the Pope,
Martin IV., himself a Frenchman. Guido, then lord of the city, led them
into a trap and overthrew them with great slaughter. Like most men of
his time Guido was a believer in astrology, and is said on this occasion
to have acted on the counsel of Guido Bonatti, mentioned among the
diviners in the Fourth Bolgia (_Inf._ xx. 118).

[699] _The Green Paws_: In 1300 the Ordelaffi were lords of Forlì. Their
arms were a green lion on a gold ground. During the first years of his
exile Dante had to do with Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi, under whose
command the exiled Florentines put themselves for a time, and there is
even a tradition that he acted as his secretary.

[700] _The Mastiffs of Verrucchio_: Verrucchio was the castle of the
Malatestas, lords of Rimini, called the Mastiffs on account of their
cruel tenacity. The elder was the father of Francesca's husband and
lover; the younger was a brother of these.

[701] _Montagna_: Montagna de' Parcitati, one of a Ghibeline family that
contested superiority in Rimini with the Guelf Malatestas, was taken
prisoner by guile and committed by the old Mastiff to the keeping of the
young one, whose fangs were set in him to such purpose that he soon died
in his dungeon.

[702] _Cities, etc._: Imola and Faenza, situated on the rivers named in
the text. Mainardo Pagani, lord of these towns, had for arms an azure
lion on a white field. During his minority he was a ward of the
Commonwealth of Florence. By his cunning and daring he earned the name
of the Demon (_Purg._ xiv. 118). He died at Imola in 1302, and was
buried in the garb of a monk of Vallombrosa. Like most of his neighbours
he changed his party as often as his interest required. He was a Guelf
in Florence and a Ghibeline in Romagna, say some.

[703] _Savio_: Cesena, on the Savio, was distinguished among the cities
of Romagna by being left more frequently than the others were to manage
its own affairs. The Malatestas and Montefeltros were in turn possessed
of the tyranny of it.

[704] _But since, etc._: The shades, being enveloped in fire, are unable
to see those with whom they speak; and so Guido does not detect in Dante
the signs of a living man, but takes him to be like himself a denizen of
Inferno. He would not have the truth regarding his fate to be known in
the world, where he is supposed to have departed life in the odour of
sanctity. Dante's promise to refresh his fame he either regards as
meaningless, or as one made without the power of fulfilling it. Dante
leaves him in his error, for he is there to learn all he can, and not to
bandy personal confessions with the shades.

[705] _A Cordelier_: In 1296 Guido entered the Franciscan Order. He died
in 1298, but where is not known; some authorities say at Venice and
others at Assisi. Benvenuto tells: 'He was often seen begging his bread
in Ancona, where he was buried. Many good deeds are related of him, and
I cherish a sweet hope that he may have been saved.'

[706] _The High Priest_: Boniface VIII.

[707] _The Pharisees new_: The members of the Court of Rome. Saint
Jerome calls the dignified Roman clergy of his day 'the Senate of the
Pharisees.'

[708] _For Christian, etc._: The foes of Boniface, here spoken of, were
the Cardinals Peter and James Colonna. He destroyed their palace in Rome
(1297) and carried the war against them to their country seat at
Palestrina, the ancient Præneste, then a great stronghold. Dante here
bitterly blames Boniface for instituting a crusade against Christians at
a time when, by the recent loss of Acre, the gate of the Holy Land had
been lost to Christendom. The Colonnas were innocent, too, of the crime
of supplying the Infidel with munitions of war--a crime condemned by the
Lateran Council of 1215, and by Boniface himself, who excluded those
guilty of it from the benefits of the great Jubilee of 1300.

[709] _Which used, etc._: In former times, when the rule of the Order
was faithfully observed. Dante charges the Franciscans with degeneracy
in the _Paradiso_, xi. 124.

[710] _From Soracte_: Referring to the well-known legend. The fee for
the cure was the fabulous Donation. See _Inf._ xix. 115.

[711] _My predecessor_: Celestine v. See _Inf._ iii. 60.

[712] _The scant performance, etc._: That Guido gave such counsel is
related by a contemporary chronicler: 'The Pope said: Tell me how to get
the better of those mine enemies, thou who art so knowing in these
things. Then he answered: Promise much, and perform little; which he
did.' But it seems odd that the wily and unscrupulous Boniface should
have needed to put himself to school for such a simple lesson.

[713] _Thou didst not think, etc._: Guido had forgot that others could
reason besides the Pope. With regard to the inefficacy of the Papal
absolution an old commentator says, following Origen: 'The Popes that
walk in the footsteps of Peter have this power of binding and loosing;
but only such as do so walk.' But on Dante's scheme of what fixes the
fate of the soul absolution matters little to save, or priestly curses
to damnify. See _Purg._ iii. 133. It is unfeigned repentance that can
help a sinner even at the last; and it is remarkable that in the case of
Buonconte, the gallant son of this same Guido, the infernal angel who
comes for him as he expires complains that he has been cheated of his
victim by one poor tear. See _Purg._ v. 88, etc. Why then is no
indulgence shown in Dante's court to Guido, who might well have been
placed in Purgatory and made to have repented effectually of this his
last sin? That Dante had any personal grudge against him we can hardly
think. In the Fourth Book of the _Convito_ (written, according to
Fraticelli, in 1297), he calls him 'our most noble Guido Montefeltrano;'
and praises him as one of the wise and noble souls that refuse to run
with full sails into the port of death, but furl the sails of their
worldly undertakings, and, relinquishing all earthly pleasures and
business, give themselves up in their old age to a religious life.
Either, then, he sets Guido here in order that he may have a modern
false counsellor worthy to be ranked with Ulysses; or because, on longer
experience, he had come to reprobate more keenly the abuse of the
Franciscan habit; or, most likely of all, that he might, even at the
cost of Guido, load the hated memory of Boniface with another reproach.

[714] _Minos_: Here we have Minos represented in the act of pronouncing
judgment in words as well as by the figurative rolling of his tail
around his body (_Inf._ v. 11).




CANTO XXVIII.


  Could any, even in words unclogged by rhyme
    Recount the wounds that now I saw,[715] and blood,
    Although he aimed at it time after time?
  Here every tongue must fail of what it would,
    Because our human speech and powers of thought
    To grasp so much come short in aptitude.
  If all the people were together brought
    Who in Apulia,[716] land distressed by fate,
    Made lamentation for the bloodshed wrought
  By Rome;[717] and in that war procrastinate[718]                  10
    When the large booty of the rings was won,
    As Livy writes whose every word has weight;
  With those on whom such direful deeds were done
    When Robert Guiscard[719] they as foes assailed;
    And those of whom still turns up many a bone
  At Ceperan,[720] where each Apulian failed
    In faith; and those at Tagliacozzo[721] strewed,
    Where old Alardo, not by arms, prevailed;
  And each his wounds and mutilations showed,
    Yet would they far behind by those be left                      20
    Who had the vile Ninth Bolgia for abode.
  No cask, of middle stave or end bereft,
    E'er gaped like one I saw the rest among,
    Slit from the chin all downward to the cleft.
  Between his legs his entrails drooping hung;
    The pluck and that foul bag were evident
    Which changes what is swallowed into dung.
  And while I gazed upon him all intent,
    Opening his breast his eyes on me he set,
    Saying: 'Behold, how by myself I'm rent!                        30
  See how dismembered now is Mahomet![722]
    Ali[723] in front of me goes weeping too;
    With visage from the chin to forelock split.
  By all the others whom thou seest there grew
    Scandal and schism while yet they breathed the day;
    Because of which they now are cloven through.
  There stands behind a devil on the way,
    Us with his sword thus cruelly to trim:
    He cleaves again each of our company
  As soon as we complete the circuit grim;                          40
    Because the wounds of each are healed outright
    Or e'er anew he goes in front of him.
  But who art thou that peerest from the height,
    It may be putting off to reach the pain
    Which shall the crimes confessed by thee requite?'
  'Death has not seized him yet, nor is he ta'en
    To torment for his sins,' my Master said;
    'But, that he may a full experience gain,
  By me, a ghost, 'tis doomed he should be led
    Down the Infernal circles, round on round;                      50
    And what I tell thee is the truth indeed.'
  A hundred shades and more, to whom the sound
    Had reached, stood in the moat to mark me well,
    Their pangs forgot; so did the words astound.
  'Let Fra Dolcin[724] provide, thou mayst him tell--
    Thou, who perchance ere long shalt sunward go--
    Unless he soon would join me in this Hell,
  Much food, lest aided by the siege of snow
    The Novarese should o'er him victory get,
    Which otherwise to win they would be slow.'                     60
  While this was said to me by Mahomet
    One foot he held uplifted; to the ground
    He let it fall, and so he forward set
  Next, one whose throat was gaping with a wound,
    Whose nose up to the brows away was sheared
    And on whose head a single ear was found,
  At me, with all the others, wondering peered;
    And, ere the rest, an open windpipe made,
    The outside of it all with crimson smeared.
  'O thou, not here because of guilt,' he said;                     70
    'And whom I sure on Latian ground did know
    Unless by strong similitude betrayed,
  Upon Pier da Medicin[725] bestow
    A thought, shouldst thou revisit the sweet plain
    That from Vercelli[726] slopes to Marcabò.
  And make thou known to Fano's worthiest twain--
    To Messer Guido and to Angiolel--
    They, unless foresight here be wholly vain,
  Thrown overboard in gyve and manacle
    Shall drown fast by Cattolica, as planned                       80
    By treachery of a tyrant fierce and fell.
  Between Majolica[727] and Cyprus strand
    A blacker crime did Neptune never spy
    By pirates wrought, or even by Argives' hand.
  The traitor[728] who is blinded of an eye,
    Lord of the town which of my comrades one
    Had been far happier ne'er to have come nigh,
  To parley with him will allure them on,
    Then so provide, against Focara's[729] blast
    No need for them of vow or orison.'                             90
  And I: 'Point out and tell, if wish thou hast
    To get news of thee to the world conveyed,
    Who rues that e'er his eyes thereon were cast?'
  On a companion's jaw his hand he laid,
    And shouted, while the mouth he open prised:
    ''Tis this one here by whom no word is said.
  He quenched all doubt in Cæsar, and advised--
    Himself an outlaw--that a man equipped
    For strife ran danger if he temporised.'
  Alas, to look on, how downcast and hipped                        100
    Curio,[730] once bold in counsel, now appeared;
    With gorge whence by the roots the tongue was ripped.
  Another one, whose hands away were sheared,
    In the dim air his stumps uplifted high
    So that his visage was with blood besmeared,
  And, 'Mosca,[731] too, remember!' loud did cry,
    'Who said, ah me! "A thing once done is done!"
    An evil seed for all in Tuscany.'
  I added: 'Yea, and death to every one
    Of thine!' whence he, woe piled on woe, his way                110
    Went like a man with grief demented grown.
  But I to watch the gang made longer stay,
    And something saw which I should have a fear,
    Without more proof, so much as even to say,
  But that my conscience bids me have good cheer--
    The comrade leal whose friendship fortifies
    A man beneath the mail of purpose clear.
  I saw in sooth (still seems it 'fore mine eyes),
    A headless trunk; with that sad company
    It forward moved, and on the selfsame wise.                    120
  The severed head, clutched by the hair, swung free
    Down from the fist, yea, lantern-like hung down;
    Staring at us it murmured: 'Wretched me!'
  A lamp he made of head-piece once his own;
    And he was two in one and one in two;
    But how, to Him who thus ordains is known.
  Arrived beneath the bridge and full in view,
    With outstretched arm his head he lifted high
    To bring his words well to us. These I knew:
  'Consider well my grievous penalty,                              130
    Thou who, though still alive, art visiting
    The people dead; what pain with this can vie?
  In order that to earth thou news mayst bring
    Of me, that I'm Bertrand de Born[732] know well,
    Who gave bad counsel to the Younger King.
  I son and sire made each 'gainst each rebel:
    David and Absalom were fooled not more
    By counsels of the false Ahithophel.
  Kinsmen so close since I asunder tore,
    Severed, alas! I carry now my brain                            140
    From what[733] it grew from in this trunk of yore:
  And so I prove the law of pain for pain.'[734]


FOOTNOTES:

[715] _That now I saw_: In the Ninth Bolgia, on which he is looking
down, and in which are punished the sowers of discord in church and
state.

[716] _Apulia_: The south-eastern district of Italy, owing to its
situation a frequent battle-field in ancient and modern times.

[717] _Rome_: 'Trojans' in most MSS.; and then the Romans are described
as descended from Trojans. The reference may be to the defeat of the
Apulians with considerable slaughter by P. Decius Mus, or to their
losses in general in the course of the Samnite war.

[718] _War procrastinate_: The second Punic war lasted fully fifteen
years, and in the course of it the battle of Cannæ was gained by
Hannibal, where so many Roman knights fell that the spoil of rings
amounted to a peck.

[719] _Guiscard_: One of the Norman conquerors of the regions which up
to our own time constituted the kingdom of Naples. In Apulia he did much
fighting against Lombards, Saracens, and Greeks. He is found by Dante in
Paradise among those who fought for the faith (_Par._ xviii. 48). His
death happened in Cephalonia in 1085, at the age of seventy, when he was
engaged on an expedition against Constantinople.

[720] _Ceperan_: In the swift and decisive campaign undertaken by
Charles of Anjou against Manfred, King of Sicily and Naples, the first
victory was obtained at Ceperano; but it was won owing to the treachery
of Manfred's lieutenant, and not by the sword. The true battle was
fought at Benevento (_Purg._ iii. 128). Ceperano may be named by Dante
as the field where the defeat of Manfred was virtually begun, and where
the Apulians first failed in loyalty to their gallant king. Dante was a
year old at the time of Manfred's overthrow (1266).

[721] _Tagliacozzo_: The crown Charles had won from Manfred he had to
defend against Manfred's nephew Conradin (grandson and last
representative of Frederick II. and the legitimate heir to the kingdom
of Sicily), whom, in 1268, he defeated near Tagliacozzo in the Abruzzi.
He made his victory the more complete by acting on the advice of Alardo
or Erard de Valery, an old Crusader, to hold good part of his force in
reserve. Charles wrote to the Pope that the slaughter was so great as
far to exceed that at Benevento. The feet of all the low-born prisoners
not slain on the field were cut off, while the gentlemen were beheaded
or hanged.

[722] _Mahomet_: It has been objected to Dante by M. Littré that he
treats Mahomet, the founder of a new religion, as a mere schismatic. The
wonder would have been had he dwelt on the good qualities of the Prophet
at a time when Islam still threatened Europe. He goes on the fact that
Mahomet and his followers rent great part of the East and South from
Christendom; and for this the Prophet is represented as being mutilated
in a sorer degree than the other schismatics.

[723] _Ali_: Son-in-law of Mahomet.

[724] _Fra Dolcin_: At the close of the thirteenth century, Boniface
being Pope, the general discontent with the corruption of the higher
clergy found expression in the north of Italy in the foundation of a new
sect, whose leader was Fra Dolcino. What he chiefly was--enthusiast,
reformer, or impostor--it is impossible to ascertain; all we know of him
being derived from writers in the Papal interest. Among other crimes he
was charged with that of teaching the lawfulness of telling an
Inquisitor a lie to save your life, and with prophesying the advent of a
pious Pope. A holy war on a small scale was preached against him. After
suffering the extremities of famine, snowed up as he was among the
mountains, he was taken prisoner and cruelly put to death (1307). It may
have been in order to save himself from being suspected of sympathy with
him, that Dante, whose hatred of Boniface and the New Pharisees was
equal to Dolcino's, provides for him by anticipation a place with
Mahomet.

[725] _Pier da Medicin_: Medicina is in the territory of Bologna. Piero
is said to have stirred up dissensions between the Polentas of Ravenna
and the Malatestas of Rimini.

[726] _From Vercelli, etc._: From the district of Vercelli to where the
castle of Marcabò once stood, at the mouth of the Po, is a distance of
two hundred miles. The plain is Lombardy.

[727] _Majolica, etc._: On all the Mediterranean, from Cyprus in the
east to Majorca in the west.

[728] _The traitor, etc._: The one-eyed traitor is Malatesta, lord of
Rimini, the Young Mastiff of the preceding Canto. He invited the two
chief citizens of Fano, named in the text, to hold a conference with
him, and procured that on their way they should be pitched overboard
opposite the castle of Cattolica, which stood between Fano and Rimini.
This is said to have happened in 1304.

[729] _Focara_: The name of a promontory near Cattolica, subject to
squalls. The victims were never to double the headland.

[730] _Curio_: The Roman Tribune who, according to Lucan--the incident
is not historically correct--found Cæsar hesitating whether to cross the
Rubicon, and advised him: _Tolle moras: semper nocuit differre paratis_.
'No delay! when men are ready they always suffer by putting off.' The
passage of the Rubicon was counted as the beginning of the Civil
War.--Curio gets scant justice, seeing that in Dante's view Cæsar in all
he did was only carrying out the Divine purpose regarding the Empire.

[731] _Mosca_: In 1215 one of the Florentine family of the Buondelmonti
jilted a daughter of the Amidei. When these with their friends met to
take counsel touching revenge for the insult, Mosca, one of the Uberti
or of the Lamberti, gave his opinion in the proverb, _Cosa fatta ha
capo_: 'A thing once done is done with.' The hint was approved of, and
on the following Easter morning the young Buondelmonte, as, mounted on a
white steed and dressed in white he rode across the Ponte Vecchio, was
dragged to the ground and cruelly slain. All the great Florentine
families took sides in the feud, and it soon widened into the civil war
between Florentine Guelf and Ghibeline.

[732] _Bertrand de Born_: Is mentioned by Dante in his Treatise _De
Vulgari Eloquio_, ii. 2, as specially the poet of warlike deeds. He was
a Gascon noble who used his poetical gift very much to stir up strife.
For patron he had the Prince Henry, son of Henry II. of England. Though
Henry never came to the throne he was, during his father's lifetime,
crowned as his successor, and was known as the young King. After the
death of the Prince, Bertrand was taken prisoner by the King, and,
according to the legend, was loaded with favours because he had been so
true a friend to his young master. That he had a turn for fomenting
discord is shown by his having also led a revolt in Aquitaine against
Richard I.--All the old MSS. and all the earlier commentators read _Re
Giovanni_, King John; _Re Giovane_, the young King, being a
comparatively modern emendation. In favour of adopting this it may be
mentioned that in his poems Bertrand calls Prince Henry _lo Reys joves_,
the young King; that it was Henry and not John that was his friend and
patron; and that in the old _Cento Novelle_ Henry is described as the
young King: in favour of the older reading, that John as well as his
brother was a rebel to Henry; and that the line is hurt by the change
from _Giovanni_ to _Giovane_. Considering that Dante almost certainly
wrote _Giovanni_ it seems most reasonable to suppose that he may have
confounded the _Re Giovane_ with King John.

[733] _From what, etc._: The spinal cord, as we should now say, though
Dante may have meant the heart.

[734] _Pain for pain_: In the City of Dis we found the heresiarchs,
those who lead others to think falsely. The lower depth of the Malebolge
is reserved for such as needlessly rend any Divinely-constituted order
of society, civil or religious. Conduct counts more with Dante than
opinion--in this case.




CANTO XXIX.


  The many folk and wounds of divers kind
    Had flushed mine eyes and set them on the flow,
    Till I to weep and linger had a mind;
  But Virgil said to me: 'Why gazing so?
    Why still thy vision fastening on the crew
    Of dismal shades dismembered there below?
  Thou didst not[735] thus the other Bolgias view:
    Think, if to count them be thine enterprise,
    The valley circles twenty miles and two.[736]
  Beneath our feet the moon[737] already lies;                      10
    The time[738] wears fast away to us decreed;
    And greater things than these await thine eyes.'
  I answered swift: 'Hadst thou but given heed
    To why it was my looks were downward bent,
    To yet more stay thou mightest have agreed.'
  My Guide meanwhile was moving, and I went
    Behind him and continued to reply,
    Adding: 'Within the moat on which intent
  I now was gazing with such eager eye
    I trow a spirit weeps, one of my kin,                           20
    The crime whose guilt is rated there so high.'
  Then said the Master: 'Henceforth hold thou in
    Thy thoughts from wandering to him: new things claim
    Attention now, so leave him with his sin.
  Him saw I at thee from the bridge-foot aim
    A threatening finger, while he made thee known;
    Geri del Bello[739] heard I named his name.
  But, at the time, thou wast with him alone
    Engrossed who once held Hautefort,[740] nor the place
    Didst look at where he was; so passed he on.'                   30
  'O Leader mine! death violent and base,
    And not avenged as yet,' I made reply,
    'By any of his partners in disgrace,
  Made him disdainful; therefore went he by
    And spake not with me, if I judge aright;
    Which does the more my ruth[741] intensify.'
  So we conversed till from the cliff we might
    Of the next valley have had prospect good
    Down to the bottom, with but clearer light.[742]
  When we above the inmost Cloister stood                           40
    Of Malebolge, and discerned the crew
    Of such as there compose the Brotherhood,[743]
  So many lamentations pierced me through--
    And barbed with pity all the shafts were sped--
    My open palms across my ears I drew.
  From Valdichiana's[744] every spital bed
    All ailments to September from July,
    With all in Maremma and Sardinia[745] bred,
  Heaped in one pit a sickness might supply
    Like what was here; and from it rose a stink                    50
    Like that which comes from limbs that putrefy.
  Then we descended by the utmost brink
    Of the long ridge[746]--leftward once more we fell--
    Until my vision, quickened now, could sink
  Deeper to where Justice infallible,
    The minister of the Almighty Lord,
    Chastises forgers doomed on earth[747] to Hell.
  Ægina[748] could no sadder sight afford,
    As I believe (when all the people ailed
    And all the air was so with sickness stored,                    60
  Down to the very worms creation failed
    And died, whereon the pristine folk once more,
    As by the poets is for certain held,
  From seed of ants their family did restore),
    Than what was offered by that valley black
    With plague-struck spirits heaped upon the floor.
  Supine some lay, each on the other's back
    Or stomach; and some crawled with crouching gait
    For change of place along the doleful track.
  Speechless we moved with step deliberate,                         70
    With eyes and ears on those disease crushed down
    Nor left them power to lift their bodies straight.
  I saw two sit, shoulder to shoulder thrown
    As plate holds plate up to be warmed, from head
    Down to the feet with scurf and scab o'ergrown.
  Nor ever saw I curry-comb so plied
    By varlet with his master standing by,
    Or by one kept unwillingly from bed,
  As I saw each of these his scratchers ply
    Upon himself; for nought else now avails                        80
    Against the itch which plagues them furiously.
  The scab[749] they tore and loosened with their nails,
    As with a knife men use the bream to strip,
    Or any other fish with larger scales.
  'Thou, that thy mail dost with thy fingers rip,'
    My Guide to one of them began to say,
    'And sometimes dost with them as pincers nip,
  Tell, is there any here from Italy
    Among you all, so may thy nails suffice
    For this their work to all eternity.'[750]                      90
  'Latians are both of us in this disguise
    Of wretchedness,' weeping said one of those;
    'But who art thou, demanding on this wise?'
  My Guide made answer: 'I am one who goes
    Down with this living man from steep to steep
    That I to him Inferno may disclose.'
  Then broke their mutual prop; trembling with deep
    Amazement each turned to me, with the rest
    To whom his words had echoed in the heap.
  Me the good Master cordially addressed:                          100
    'Whate'er thou hast a mind to ask them, say.'
    And since he wished it, thus I made request:
  'So may remembrance of you not decay
    Within the upper world out of the mind
    Of men, but flourish still for many a day,
  As ye shall tell your names and what your kind:
    Let not your vile, disgusting punishment
    To full confession make you disinclined.'
  'An Aretine,[751] I to the stake was sent
    By Albert of Siena,' one confessed,                            110
    'But came not here through that for which I went
  To death. 'Tis true I told him all in jest,
    I through the air could float in upward gyre;
    And he, inquisitive and dull at best,
  Did full instruction in the art require:
    I could not make him Dædalus,[752] so then
    His second father sent me to the fire.
  But to the deepest Bolgia of the ten,
    For alchemy which in the world I wrought,
    The unerring Minos doomed me.' 'Now were men
  E'er found,' I of the Poet asked, 'so fraught                    121
    With vanity as are the Sienese?[753]
    French vanity to theirs is surely nought.'
  The other leper hearing me, to these
    My words: 'Omit the Stricca,'[754] swift did shout,
    'Who knew his tastes with temperance to please;
  And Nicholas,[755] who earliest found out
    The lavish custom of the clove-stuffed roast
    Within the garden where such seed doth sprout.
  Nor count the club[756] where Caccia d' Ascian lost              130
    Vineyards and woods; 'mid whom away did throw
    His wit the Abbagliato.[757] But whose ghost
  It is, that thou mayst weet, that backs thee so
    Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eyes
    That thou my countenance mayst surely know.
  In me Capocchio's[758] shade thou'lt recognise,
    Who forged false coin by means of alchemy:
    Thou must remember, if I well surmise,
  How I of nature very ape could be.'


FOOTNOTES:

[735] _Thou didst not, etc._: It is a noteworthy feature in the conduct
of the Poem that when Dante has once gained sufficient knowledge of any
group in the Inferno he at once detaches his mind from it, and, carrying
on as little arrear of pity as he can, gives his thoughts to further
progress on the journey. The departure here made from his usual
behaviour is presently accounted for. Virgil knows why he lingers, but
will not seem to approve of the cause.

[736] _Twenty miles and two_: The Ninth Bolgia has a circumference of
twenty-two miles, and as the procession of the shades is slow it would
indeed involve a protracted halt to wait till all had passed beneath the
bridge. Virgil asks ironically if he wishes to count them all. This
precise detail, taken along with one of the same kind in the following
Canto (line 86), has suggested the attempt to construct the Inferno to a
scale. Dante wisely suffers us to forget, if we will, that--taking the
diameter of the earth at 6500 miles, as given by him in the
_Convito_--he travels from the surface of the globe to the centre at the
rate of more than two miles a minute, counting downward motion alone. It
is only when he has come to the lowest rings that he allows himself to
give details of size; and probably the mention of the extent of the
Ninth Bolgia, which comes on the reader as a surprise, is thrown out in
order to impress on the imagination some sense of the enormous extent of
the regions through which the pilgrim has already passed. Henceforth he
deals in exact measurement.

[737] _The moon_: It is now some time after noon on the Saturday. The
last indication of time was at Canto xxi. 112.

[738] _The time, etc._: Before nightfall they are to complete their
exploration of the Inferno, and they will have spent twenty-four hours
in it.

[739] _Geri del Bello_: One of the Alighieri, a full cousin of Dante's
father. He was guilty of encouraging dissension, say the commentators;
which is to be clearly inferred from the place assigned him in Inferno:
but they do not agree as to how he met his death, nor do they mention
the date of it. 'Not avenged till thirty years after,' says Landino; but
does not say if this was after his death or the time at which Dante
writes.

[740] _Hautefort_: Bertrand de Born's castle in Gascony.

[741] _My ruth_: Enlightened moralist though Dante is, he yet shows
himself man of his age enough to be keenly alive to the extremest claims
of kindred; and while he condemns the _vendetta_ by the words put into
Virgil's mouth, he confesses to a feeling of meanness not to have
practised it on behoof of a distant relative. There is a high art in
this introduction of Geri del Bello. Had they conferred together Dante
must have seemed either cruel or pusillanimous, reproaching or being
reproached. As it is, all the poetry of the situation comes out the
stronger that they do not meet face to face: the threatening finger, the
questions hastily put to Geri by the astonished shades, and his
disappearance under the dark vault when by the law of his punishment the
sinner can no longer tarry.

[742] _With but clearer light_: They have crossed the rampart dividing
the Ninth Bolgia from the Tenth, of which they would now command a view,
were it not so dark.

[743] _The Brotherhood_: The word used properly describes the Lay
Brothers of a monastery. Philalethes suggests that Dante may regard the
devils as the true monks of the monastery of Malebolge. The simile
involves no contempt for the monastic life, but is naturally used with
reference to those who live secluded and under a fixed rule. He
elsewhere speaks of the College of the Hypocrites (_Inf._ xxiii. 91) and
of Paradise as the Cloister where Christ is Abbot (_Purg._ xxvi.129).

[744] _Valdichiana_: The district lying between Arezzo and Chiusi; in
Dante's time a hotbed of malaria, but now, owing to drainage works
promoted by the enlightened Tuscan minister Fossombroni (1823), one of
the most fertile and healthy regions of Italy.

[745] _Sardinia_: Had in the middle ages an evil reputation for its
fever-stricken air. The Maremma has been already mentioned (_Inf._
xxv.19). In Dante's time it was almost unpeopled.

[746] _The long ridge_: One of the ribs of rock which, like the spokes
of a wheel, ran from the periphery to the centre of Malebolge, rising
into arches as they crossed each successive Bolgia. The utmost brink is
the inner bank of the Tenth and last Bolgia. To the edge of this moat
they descend, bearing as usual to the left hand.

[747] _Doomed on earth, etc._: 'Whom she here registers.' While they are
still on earth their doom is fixed by Divine justice.

[748] _Ægina_: The description is taken from Ovid (_Metam._ vii.).

[749] _The scab, etc._: As if by an infernal alchemy the matter of the
shadowy bodies of these sinners is changed into one loathsome form or
another.

[750] _To all eternity_: This may seem a stroke of sarcasm, but is not.
Himself a shade, Virgil cannot, like Dante, promise to refresh the
memory of the shades on earth, and can only wish for them some slight
alleviation of their suffering.

[751] _An Aretine_: Called Griffolino, and burned at Florence or Siena
on a charge of heresy. Albert of Siena is said to have been a relative,
some say the natural son, of the Bishop of Siena. A man of the name
figures as hero in some of Sacchetti's novels, always in a ridiculous
light. There seems to be no authentic testimony regarding the incident
in the text.

[752] _Dædalus_: Who escaped on wings of his invention from the Cretan
Labyrinth he had made and lost himself in.

[753] _The Sienese_: The comparison of these to the French would have
the more cogency as Siena boasted of having been founded by the Gauls.
'That vain people,' says Dante of the Sienese in the _Purgatory_ (xiii.
151). Among their neighbours they still bear the reputation of
light-headedness; also, it ought to be added, of great urbanity.

[754] _The Stricca_: The exception in his favour is ironical, as is that
of all the others mentioned.

[755] _Nicholas_: 'The lavish custom of the clove' which he invented is
variously described. I have chosen the version which makes it consist of
stuffing pheasants with cloves, then very costly.

[756] _The club_: The commentators tell that the two young Sienese
nobles above mentioned were members of a society formed for the purpose
of living luxuriously together. Twelve of them contributed a fund of
above two hundred thousand gold florins; they built a great palace and
furnished it magnificently, and launched out into every other sort of
extravagance with such assiduity that in a few months their capital was
gone. As that amounted to more than a hundred thousand pounds of our
money, equal in those days to a million or two, the story must be held
to savour of romance. That Dante refers to a prodigal's club that
actually existed some time before he wrote we cannot doubt. But it seems
uncertain, to say the least, whether the sonnets addressed by the Tuscan
poet Folgore da Gemignano to a jovial crew in Siena can be taken as
having been inspired by the club Dante speaks of. A translation of them
is given by Mr. Rossetti in his _Circle of Dante_. (See Mr. Symonds's
_Renaissance_, vol. iv. page 54, _note_, for doubts as to the date of
Folgore.)--_Caccia d' Ascian_: Whose short and merry club life cost him
his estates near Siena.

[757] _The Abbagliato_: Nothing is known, though a great deal is
guessed, about this member of the club. It is enough to know that,
having a scant supply of wit, he spent it freely.

[758] _Capocchio_: Some one whom Dante knew. Whether he was a Florentine
or a Sienese is not ascertained, but from the strain of his mention of
the Sienese we may guess Florentine. He was burned in Siena in
1293.--(Scartazzini.) They had studied together, says the _Anonimo_.
Benvenuto tells of him that one Good Friday, while in a cloister, he
painted on his nail with marvellous completeness a picture of the
crucifixion. Dante came up, and was lost in wonder, when Capocchio
suddenly licked his nail clean--which may be taken for what it is worth.




CANTO XXX.


  Because of Semele[759] when Juno's ire
    Was fierce 'gainst all that were to Thebes allied,
    As had been proved by many an instance dire;
  So mad grew Athamas[760] that when he spied
    His wife as she with children twain drew near,
    Each hand by one encumbered, loud he cried:
  'Be now the nets outspread, that I may snare
    Cubs with the lioness at yon strait ground!'
    And stretching claws of all compassion bare
  He on Learchus seized and swung him round,                        10
    And shattered him upon a flinty stone;
    Then she herself and the other burden drowned.
  And when by fortune was all overthrown
    The Trojans' pride, inordinate before--
    Monarch and kingdom equally undone--
  Hecuba,[761] sad and captive, mourning o'er
    Polyxena, when dolorous she beheld
    The body of her darling Polydore
  Upon the coast, out of her wits she yelled,
    And spent herself in barking like a hound;                      20
    So by her sorrow was her reason quelled.
  But never yet was Trojan fury[762] found,
    Nor that of Thebes, to sting so cruelly
    Brute beasts, far less the human form to wound,
  As two pale naked shades were stung, whom I
    Saw biting run, like swine when they escape
    Famished and eager from the empty sty.
  Capocchio[763] coming up to, in his nape
    One fixed his fangs, and hauling at him made
    His belly on the stony pavement scrape.                         30
  The Aretine[764] who stood, still trembling, said:
    'That imp is Gianni Schicchi,[765] and he goes
    Rabid, thus trimming others.' 'O!' I prayed,
  'So may the teeth of the other one of those
    Not meet in thee, as, ere she pass from sight,
    Thou freely shalt the name of her disclose.'
  And he to me: 'That is the ancient sprite
    Of shameless Myrrha,[766] who let liking rise
    For him who got her, past all bounds of right.
  As, to transgress with him, she in disguise                       40
    Came near to him deception to maintain;
    So he, departing yonder from our eyes,
  That he the Lady of the herd might gain,
    Bequeathed his goods by formal testament
    While he Buoso Donate's[767] form did feign.'
  And when the rabid couple from us went,
    Who all this time by me were being eyed,
    Upon the rest ill-starred I grew intent;
  And, fashioned like a lute, I one espied,
    Had he been only severed at the place                           50
    Where at the groin men's lower limbs divide.
  The grievous dropsy, swol'n with humours base,
    Which every part of true proportion strips
    Till paunch grows out of keeping with the face,
  Compelled him widely ope to hold his lips
    Like one in fever who, by thirst possessed,
    Has one drawn up while the other chinward slips.
  'O ye![768] who by no punishment distressed,
    Nor know I why, are in this world of dool,'
    He said; 'a while let your attention rest                       60
  On Master Adam[769] here of misery full.
    Living, I all I wished enjoyed at will;
    Now lust I for a drop of water cool.
  The water-brooks that down each grassy hill
    Of Casentino to the Arno fall
    And with cool moisture all their courses fill--
  Always, and not in vain, I see them all;
    Because the vision of them dries me more
    Than the disease 'neath which my face grows small.
  For rigid justice, me chastising sore,                            70
    Can in the place I sinned at motive find
    To swell the sighs in which I now deplore.
  There lies Romena, where of the money coined[770]
    With the Baptist's image I made counterfeit,
    And therefore left my body burnt behind.
  But could I see here Guido's[771] wretched sprite,
    Or Alexander's, or their brother's, I
    For Fonte Branda[772] would not give the sight.
  One is already here, unless they lie--
    Mad souls with power to wander through the crowd--
    What boots it me, whose limbs diseases tie?                     81
  But were I yet so nimble that I could
    Creep one poor inch a century, some while
    Ago had I begun to take the road
  Searching for him among this people vile;
    And that although eleven miles[773] 'tis long,
    And has a width of more than half a mile.
  Because of them am I in such a throng;
    For to forge florins I by them was led,
    Which by three carats[774] of alloy were wrong,'                90
  'Who are the wretches twain,' I to him said,
    'Who smoke[775] like hand in winter-time fresh brought
    From water, on thy right together spread?'
  'Here found I them, nor have they budged a jot,'
    He said, 'since I was hurled into this vale;
    And, as I deem, eternally they'll not.
  One[776] with false charges Joseph did assail;
    False Sinon,[777] Greek from Troy, is the other wight.
    Burning with fever they this stink exhale.'
  Then one of them, perchance o'ercome with spite                  100
    Because he thus contemptuously was named,
    Smote with his fist upon the belly tight.
  It sounded like a drum; and then was aimed
    A blow by Master Adam at his face
    With arm no whit less hard, while he exclaimed:
  'What though I can no longer shift my place
    Because my members by disease are weighed!
    I have an arm still free for such a case.'
  To which was answered: 'When thou wast conveyed
    Unto the fire 'twas not thus good at need,                     110
    But even more so when the coiner's trade
  Was plied by thee.' The swol'n one: 'True indeed!
    But thou didst not bear witness half so true
    When Trojans[778] at thee for the truth did plead.'
  'If I spake falsely, thou didst oft renew
    False coin,' said Sinon; 'one fault brought me here;
    Thee more than any devil of the crew.'
  'Bethink thee of the horse, thou perjurer,'
    He of the swol'n paunch answered; 'and that by
    All men 'tis known should anguish in thee stir.'               120
  'Be thirst that cracks thy tongue thy penalty,
    And putrid water,' so the Greek replied,
    'Which 'fore thine eyes thy stomach moundeth high.'
  The coiner then: 'Thy mouth thou openest wide,
    As thou art used, thy slanderous words to vent;
    But if I thirst and humours plump my hide
  Thy head throbs with the fire within thee pent.
    To lap Narcissus' mirror,[779] to implore
    And urge thee on would need no argument.'
  While I to hear them did attentive pore                          130
    My Master said: 'Thy fill of staring take!
    To rouse my anger needs but little more.'
  And when I heard that he in anger spake
    Toward him I turned with such a shame inspired,
    Recalled, it seems afresh on me to break.
  And, as the man who dreams of hurt is fired
    With wish that he might know his dream a dream,
    And so what is, as 'twere not, is desired;
  So I, struck dumb and filled with an extreme
    Craving to find excuse, unwittingly                            140
    The meanwhile made the apology supreme.
  'Less shame,' my Master said, 'would nullify
    A greater fault, for greater guilt atone;
    All sadness for it, therefore, lay thou by.
  But bear in mind that thou art not alone,
    If fortune hap again to bring thee near
    Where people such debate are carrying on.
  To things like these 'tis shame[780] to lend an ear.'


FOOTNOTES:

[759] _Semele_: The daughter of Cadmus, founder and king of Thebes, was
beloved by Jupiter and therefore hated by Juno, who induced her to court
destruction by urging the god to visit her, as he was used to come to
Juno, in all his glory. And in other instances the goddess took revenge
(Ovid, _Metam._ iv.).

[760] _Athamas_: Married to a sister of Semele, was made insane by the
angry Juno, with the result described in the text.

[761] _Hecuba_: Wife of Priam, king of Troy, and mother of Polyxena and
Polydorus. While she was lamenting the death of her daughter, slain as
an offering on the tomb of Achilles, she found the corpse of her son,
slain by the king of Thrace, to whose keeping she had committed him
(Ovid, _Metam._ xiii.).

[762] _Trojan fury, etc._: It was by the agency of a Fury that Athamas
was put out of his mind; but the Trojan and Theban furies here meant are
the frenzies of Athamas and Hecuba, wild with which one of them slew his
son, and the other scratched out the eyes of the Thracian king.

[763] _Capocchio_: See close of the preceding Canto. Here as elsewhere
sinners are made ministers of vengeance on one another.

[764] _The Aretine_: Griffolino, who boasted he could fly; already
represented as trembling (_Inf._ xxix. 97).

[765] _Gianni Schicchi_: Giovanni Schicchi, one of the Cavalcanti of
Florence.

[766] _Myrrha_: This is a striking example of Dante's detestation of
what may be called heartless sins. It is covered by the classification
of Canto xi. Yet it is almost with a shock that we find Myrrha here for
personation, and not rather condemned to some other circle for another
sin.

[767] _Buoso Donati_: Introduced as a thief in the Seventh Bolgia
(_Inf._ xxv. 140). Buoso was possessed of a peerless mare, known as the
Lady of the herd. To make some amends for his unscrupulous acquisition
of wealth, he made a will bequeathing legacies to various religious
communities. When he died his nephew Simon kept the fact concealed long
enough to procure a personation of him as if on his death-bed by Gianni
Schicchi, who had great powers of mimicry. Acting in the character of
Buoso, the rogue professed his wish to make a new disposition of his
means, and after specifying some trifling charitable bequests the better
to maintain his assumed character, named Simon as general legatee, and
bequeathed Buoso's mare to himself.

[768] _O ye, etc._: The speaker has heard and noted Virgil's words of
explanation given in the previous Canto, line 94.

[769] _Master Adam_: Adam of Brescia, an accomplished worker in metals,
was induced by the Counts Guidi of Romena in the Casentino, the upland
district of the upper Arno, to counterfeit the gold coin of Florence.
This false coin is mentioned in a Chronicle as having been in
circulation in 1281. It must therefore have been somewhat later that
Master Adam was burned, as he was by sentence of the Republic, upon the
road which led from Romena to Florence. A cairn still existing near the
ruined castle bears the name of the 'dead man's cairn.'

[770] _The money coined, etc._: The gold florin, afterwards adopted in
so many countries, was first struck in 1252; 'which florins weighed
eight to the ounce, and bore the lily on the one side, and on the other
Saint John.'--(Villani, vi. 54.) The piece was thus of about the weight
of our half-sovereign. The gold was of twenty-four carats; that is, it
had no alloy. The coin soon passed into wide circulation, and to
maintain its purity became for the Florentines a matter of the first
importance. Villani, in the chapter above cited, tells how the King of
Tunis finding the florin to be of pure gold sent for some of the Pisans,
then the chief traders in his ports, and asked who were the Florentines
that they coined such money. 'Only our Arabs,' was the answer; meaning
that they were rough country folk, dependent on Pisa. 'Then what is your
coin like?' he asked. A Florentine of Oltrarno named Pera Balducci, who
was present, took the opportunity of informing him how great Florence
was compared with Pisa, as was shown by that city having no gold coinage
of its own; whereupon the King made the Florentines free of Tunis, and
allowed them to have a factory there. 'And this,' adds Villani, who had
himself been agent abroad for a great Florentine house of business, 'we
had at first hand from the aforesaid Pera, a man worthy of credit, and
with whom we were associated in the Priorate.'

[771] _Guido, etc._: The Guidi of Romena were a branch of the great
family of the Counts Guidi. The father of the three brothers in the text
was grandson of the old Guido that married the Good Gualdrada, and
cousin of the Guidoguerra met by Dante in the Seventh Circle (_Inf._
xvi. 38). How the third brother was called is not settled, nor which of
the three was already dead in the beginning of 1300. The Alexander of
Romena, who for some time was captain of the banished Florentine Whites,
was, most probably, he of the text. A letter is extant professing to be
written by Dante to two of Alexander's nephews on the occasion of his
death, in which the poet excuses himself for absence from the funeral on
the plea of poverty. By the time he wrote the _Inferno_ he may, owing to
their shifty politics, have lost all liking for the family, yet it seems
harsh measure that is here dealt to former friends and patrons.

[772] _Fonte Branda_: A celebrated fountain in the city of Siena. Near
Romena is a spring which is also named Fonte Branda; and this, according
to the view now most in favour, was meant by Master Adam. But was it so
named in Dante's time? Or was it not so called only when the _Comedy_
had begun to awaken a natural interest in the old coiner, which local
ingenuity did its best to meet? The early commentators know nothing of
the Casentino Fonte Branda, and, though it is found mentioned under the
date of 1539, that does not take us far enough back. In favour of the
Sienese fountain is the consideration that it was the richest of any in
the Tuscan cities; that it was a great architectural as well as
engineering work; and that, although now more than half a century old,
it was still the subject of curiosity with people far and near. Besides,
Adam has already recalled the brooks of Casentino, and so the mention of
the paltry spring at Romena would introduce no fresh idea like that of
the abundant waters of the great fountain which daily quenched the
thirst of thousands.

[773] _Eleven miles_: It will be remembered that the previous Bolgia was
twenty-two miles in circumference.

[774] _Three carats_: Three carats in twenty-four being of some foreign
substance.

[775] _Who smoke, etc._: This description of sufferers from high fever,
like that of Master Adam with his tympanitis, has the merit, such as it
is, of being true to the life.

[776] _One, etc._: Potiphar's wife.

[777] _Sinon_: Called of Troy, as being known through his conduct at the
siege. He pretended to have deserted from the Greeks, and by a false
story persuaded the Trojans to admit the fatal wooden horse.

[778] _When Trojans, etc._: When King Priam sought to know for what
purpose the wooden horse was really constructed.

[779] _Narcissus' mirror_: The pool in which Narcissus saw his form
reflected.

[780] _'Tis shame_: Dante knows that Virgil would have scorned to
portray such a scene of low life as this, but he must allow himself a
wider licence and here as elsewhere refuses nothing, even in the way of
mean detail, calculated to convey to his readers 'a full experience of
the Inferno' as he conceived of it--the place 'where all the vileness of
the world is cast.'




CANTO XXXI.


  The very tongue that first had caused me pain,
    Biting till both my cheeks were crimsoned o'er,
    With healing medicine me restored again.
  So have I heard, the lance Achilles[781] bore,
    Which earlier was his father's, first would wound
    And then to health the wounded part restore.
  From that sad valley[782] we our backs turned round,
    Up the encircling rampart making way
    Nor uttering, as we crossed it, any sound.
  Here was it less than night and less than day,                    10
    And scarce I saw at all what lay ahead;
    But of a trumpet the sonorous bray--
  No thunder-peal were heard beside it--led
    Mine eyes along the line by which it passed,
    Till on one spot their gaze concentrated.
  When by the dolorous rout was overcast
    The sacred enterprise of Charlemagne
    Roland[783] blew not so terrible a blast.
  Short time my head was that way turned, when plain
    I many lofty towers appeared to see.                            20
    'Master, what town is this?' I asked. 'Since fain
  Thou art,' he said, 'to pierce the obscurity
    While yet through distance 'tis inscrutable,
    Thou must of error needs the victim be.
  Arriving there thou shalt distinguish well
    How much by distance was thy sense betrayed;
    Therefore to swifter course thyself compel.'
  Then tenderly[784] he took my hand, and said:
    'Ere we pass further I would have thee know,
    That at the fact thou mayst be less dismayed,                   30
  These are not towers but giants; in a row
    Set round the brink each in the pit abides,
    His navel hidden and the parts below.'
  And even as when the veil of mist divides
    Little by little dawns upon the sight
    What the obscuring vapour earlier hides;
  So, piercing the gross air uncheered by light,
    As I step after step drew near the bound
    My error fled, but I was filled with fright.
  As Montereggion[785] with towers is crowned                       40
    Which from the walls encircling it arise;
    So, rising from the pit's encircling mound,
  Half of their bodies towered before mine eyes--
    Dread giants, still by Jupiter defied
    From Heaven whene'er it thunders in the skies.
  The face of one already I descried,
    His shoulders, breast, and down his belly far,
    And both his arms dependent by his side.
  When Nature ceased such creatures as these are
    To form, she of a surety wisely wrought                         50
    Wresting from Mars such ministers of war.
  And though she rue not that to life she brought
    The whale and elephant, who deep shall read
    Will justify her wisdom in his thought;
  For when the powers of intellect are wed
    To strength and evil will, with them made one,
    The race of man is helpless left indeed.
  As large and long as is St. Peter's cone[786]
    At Rome, the face appeared; of every limb
    On scale like this was fashioned every bone.                    60
  So that the bank, which covered half of him
    As might a tunic, left uncovered yet
    So much that if to his hair they sought to climb
  Three Frisians[787] end on end their match had met;
    For thirty great palms I of him could see,
    Counting from where a man's cloak-clasp is set.
  _Rafel[788] mai amech zabi almi!_
    Out of the bestial mouth began to roll,
    Which scarce would suit more dulcet psalmody.
  And then my Leader charged him: 'Stupid soul,                     70
    Stick to thy horn. With it relieve thy mind
    When rage or other passions pass control.
  Feel at thy neck, round which the thong is twined
    O puzzle-headed wretch! from which 'tis slung;
    Clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find.'
  And then to me: 'From his own mouth is wrung
    Proof of his guilt. 'Tis Nimrod, whose insane
    Whim hindered men from speaking in one tongue.
  Leave we him here nor spend our speech in vain;
    For words to him in any language said,                          80
    As unto others his, no sense contain.'
  Turned to the left, we on our journey sped,
    And at the distance of an arrow's flight
    We found another huger and more dread.
  By what artificer thus pinioned tight
    I cannot tell, but his left arm was bound
    In front, as at his back was bound the right,
  By a chain which girt him firmly round and round;
    About what of his frame there was displayed
    Below the neck, in fivefold gyre 'twas wound.                   90
  'Incited by ambition this one made
    Trial of prowess 'gainst Almighty Jove,'
    My Leader told, 'and he is thus repaid.
  'Tis Ephialtes,[789] mightily who strove
    What time the giants to the gods caused fright:
    The arms he wielded then no more will move.'
  And I to him: 'Fain would I, if I might,
    On the enormous Briareus set eye,
    And know the truth by holding him in sight.'
  'Antæus[790] thou shalt see,' he made reply,                     100
    'Ere long, and he can speak, nor is in chains.
    Us to the depth of all iniquity
  He shall let down. The one thou'dst see[791] remains
    Far off, like this one bound and like in make,
    But in his face far more of fierceness reigns.'
  Never when earth most terribly did quake
    Shook any tower so much as what all o'er
    And suddenly did Ephialtes shake.
  Terror of death possessed me more and more;
    The fear alone had served my turn indeed,                      110
    But that I marked the ligatures he wore.
  Then did we somewhat further on proceed,
    Reaching Antæus who for good five ell,[792]
    His head not counted, from the pit was freed.
  'O thou who from the fortune-haunted dell[793]--
    Where Scipio of glory was made heir
    When with his host to flight turned Hannibal--
  A thousand lions didst for booty bear
    Away, and who, hadst thou but joined the host
    And like thy brethren fought, some even aver                   120
  The victory to earth's sons had not been lost,
    Lower us now, nor disobliging show,
    To where Cocytus[794] fettered is by frost.
  To Tityus[795] nor to Typhon make us go.
    To grant what here is longed for he hath power,
    Cease them to curl thy snout, but bend thee low.
  He can for wage thy name on earth restore;
    He lives, and still expecteth to live long,
    If Grace recall him not before his hour.'
  So spake my Master. Then his hands he swung                      130
    Downward and seized my Leader in all haste--
    Hands in whose grip even Hercules once was wrung.
  And Virgil when he felt them round him cast
    Said: 'That I may embrace thee, hither tend,'
    And in one bundle with him made me fast.
  And as to him that under Carisend[796]
    Stands on the side it leans to, while clouds fly
    Counter its slope, the tower appears to bend;
  Even so to me who stood attentive by
    Antæus seemed to stoop, and I, dismayed,                       140
    Had gladly sought another road to try.
  But us in the abyss he gently laid,
    Where Lucifer and Judas gulfed remain;
    Nor to it thus bent downward long time stayed,
  But like a ship's mast raised himself again.


FOOTNOTES:

[781] _Achilles_: The rust upon his lance had virtue to heal the wound.

[782] _From that sad valley_: Leaving the Tenth and last Bolgia they
climb the inner bank of it and approach the Ninth and last Circle, which
consists of the pit of the Inferno.

[783] _Roland_: Charles the Great, on his march north after defeating
the Saracens at Saragossa, left Roland to bring up his rear-guard. The
enemy fell on this in superior strength, and slew the Christians almost
to a man. Then Roland, mortally wounded, sat down under a tree in
Roncesvalles and blew upon his famous horn a blast so loud that it was
heard by Charles at a distance of several miles.--The _Chansons de
Geste_ were familiarly known to Italians of all classes.

[784] _Then tenderly, etc._: The wound inflicted by his reproof has been
already healed, but Virgil still behaves to Dante with more than his
wonted gentleness. He will have him assured of his sympathy now that
they are about to descend into the 'lowest depth of all wickedness.'

[785] _Montereggioni_: A fortress about six miles from Siena, of which
ample ruins still exist. It had no central keep, but twelve towers rose
from its circular wall like spikes from the rim of a coronet. They had
been added by the Sienese in 1260, and so were comparatively new in
Dante's time.--As the towers stood round Montereggioni so the giants at
regular intervals stand round the central pit. They have their foothold
within the enclosing mound; and thus, to one looking at them from
without, they are hidden by it up to their middle. As the embodiment of
superhuman impious strength and pride they stand for warders of the
utmost reach of Hell.

[786] _St. Peter's cone_: The great pine cone of bronze, supposed to
have originally crowned the mausoleum of Hadrian, lay in Dante's time in
the forecourt of St Peter's. When the new church was built it was
removed to the gardens of the Vatican, where it still remains. Its size,
it will be seen, is of importance as helping us to a notion of the
stature of the giants; and, though the accounts of its height are
strangely at variance with one another, I think the measurement made
specially for Philalethes may be accepted as substantially correct.
According to that, the cone is ten palms long--about six feet. Allowing
something for the neck, down to 'where a man clasps his cloak' (line
66), and taking the thirty palms as eighteen feet, we get twenty-six
feet or so for half his height. The giants vary in bulk; whether they do
so in height is not clear. We cannot be far mistaken if we assume them
to stand from fifty to sixty feet high. Virgil and Dante must throw
their heads well back to look up into the giant's face; and Virgil must
raise his voice as he speaks.--With regard to the height of the cone it
may be remarked that Murray's Handbook for Rome makes it eleven feet
high; Gsell-Fels two and a half metres, or eight feet and three inches.
It is so placed as to be difficult of measurement.

[787] _Three Frisians_: Three very tall men, as Dante took Frisians to
be, if standing one on the head of the other would not have reached his
hair.

[788] _Rafel, etc._: These words, like the opening line of the Seventh
Canto, have, to no result, greatly exercised the ingenuity of scholars.
From what follows it is clear that Dante meant them to be meaningless.
Part of Nimrod's punishment is that he who brought about the confusion
of tongues is now left with a language all to himself. It seems strange
that commentators should have exhausted themselves in searching for a
sense in words specially invented to have none.--In his _De Vulg. El._,
i. 7, Dante enlarges upon the confusion of tongues, and speaks of the
tower of Babel as having been begun by men on the persuasion of a giant.

[789] _Ephialtes_: One of the giants who in the war with the gods piled
Ossa on Pelion.

[790] _Antæus_: Is to be asked to lift them over the wall, because,
unlike Nimrod, he can understand what is said to him, and, unlike
Ephialtes, is not bound. Antæus is free-handed because he took no part
in the war with the gods.

[791] _The one thou'dst see_: Briareus. Virgil here gives Dante to know
what is the truth about Briareus (see line 97, etc.). He is not, as he
was fabled, a monster with a hundred hands, but is like Ephialtes, only
fiercer to see. Hearing himself thus made light of Ephialtes trembles
with anger, like a tower rocking in an earthquake.

[792] _Five ell_: Five ells make about thirty palms, so that Antæus is
of the same stature as that assigned to Nimrod at line 65. This supports
the view that the 'huger' of line 84 may apply to breadth rather than to
height.

[793] _The fortune-haunted dell_: The valley of the Bagrada near Utica,
where Scipio defeated Hannibal and won the surname of Africanus. The
giant Antæus had, according to the legend, lived in that neighbourhood,
with the flesh of lions for his food and his dwelling in a cave. He was
son of the Earth, and could not be vanquished so long as he was able to
touch the ground; and thus ere Hercules could give him a mortal hug he
needed to swing him aloft. In the _Monarchia_, ii. 10, Dante refers to
the combat between Hercules and Antæus as an instance of the wager of
battle corresponding to that between David and Goliath. Lucan's
_Pharsalia_, a favourite authority with Dante, supplies him with these
references to Scipio and Antæus.

[794] _Cocytus_: The frozen lake fed by the waters of Phlegethon. See
Canto xiv. at the end.

[795] _Tityus, etc._: These were other giants, stated by Lucan to be
less strong than Antæus. This introduction of their names is therefore a
piece of flattery to the monster. A light contemptuous turn is given by
Virgil to his flattery when in the following sentence he bids Antæus not
curl his snout, but at once comply with the demand for aid. There is
something genuinely Italian in the picture given of the giants in this
Canto, as of creatures whose intellect bears no proportion to their bulk
and brute strength. Mighty hunters like Nimrod, skilled in sounding the
horn but feeble in reasoned speech, Frisians with great thews and long
of limb, and German men-at-arms who traded in their rude valour, to the
subtle Florentine in whom the ferment of the Renaissance was beginning
to work were all specimens of Nature's handicraft that had better have
been left unmade, were it not that wiser people could use them as tools.

[796] _Carisenda_: A tower still standing in Bologna, built at the
beginning of the twelfth century, and, like many others of its kind in
the city, erected not for strength but merely in order to dignify the
family to whom it belonged. By way of further distinction to their
owners, some of these towers were so constructed as to lean from the
perpendicular. Carisenda, like its taller neighbour the Asinelli, still
supplies a striking feature to the near and distant views of Bologna.
What is left of it hangs for more than two yards off the plumb. In the
half-century after Dante's time it had, according to Benvenuto, lost
something of its height. It would therefore as the poet saw it seem to
be bending down even more than it now does to any one standing under it
on the side it slopes to, when a cloud is drifting over it in the other
direction.




CANTO XXXII.


  Had I sonorous rough rhymes at command,
    Such as would suit the cavern terrible
    Rooted on which all the other ramparts stand,
  The sap of fancies which within me swell
    Closer I'd press; but since I have not these,
    With some misgiving I go on to tell.
  For 'tis no task to play with as you please,
    Of all the world the bottom to portray,
    Nor one that with a baby speech[797] agrees.
  But let those ladies help me with my lay                          10
    Who helped Amphion[798] walls round Thebes to pile,
    And faithful to the facts my words shall stay.
  O 'bove all creatures wretched, for whose vile
    Abode 'tis hard to find a language fit,
    As sheep or goats ye had been happier! While
  We still were standing in the murky pit--
    Beneath the giant's feet[799] set far below--
    And at the high wall I was staring yet,
  When this I heard: 'Heed to thy steps[800] bestow,
    Lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned                    20
    Of wretched brothers wearied in their woe.'
  Before me, as on hearing this I turned,
    Beneath my feet a frozen lake,[801] its guise
    Rather of glass than water, I discerned.
  In all its course on Austrian Danube lies
    No veil in time of winter near so thick,
    Nor on the Don beneath its frigid skies,
  As this was here; on which if Tabernicch[802]
    Or Mount Pietrapana[803] should alight
    Not even the edge would answer with a creak.                    30
  And as the croaking frog holds well in sight
    Its muzzle from the pool, what time of year[804]
    The peasant girl of gleaning dreams at night;
  The mourning shades in ice were covered here,
    Seen livid up to where we blush[805] with shame.
    In stork-like music their teeth chattering were.
  With downcast face stood every one of them:
    To cold from every mouth, and to despair
    From every eye, an ample witness came.
  And having somewhat gazed around me there                         40
    I to my feet looked down, and saw two pressed
    So close together, tangled was their hair,
  'Say, who are you with breast[806] thus strained to breast?'
    I asked; whereon their necks they backward bent,
    And when their upturned faces lay at rest
  Their eyes, which earlier were but moistened, sent
    Tears o'er their eyelids: these the frost congealed
    And fettered fast[807] before they further went.
  Plank set to plank no rivet ever held
    More firmly; wherefore, goat-like, either ghost                 50
    Butted the other; so their wrath prevailed.
  And one who wanted both ears, which the frost
    Had bitten off, with face still downward thrown,
    Asked: 'Why with us art thou so long engrossed?
  If who that couple are thou'dst have made known--
    The vale down which Bisenzio's floods decline
    Was once their father Albert's[808] and their own.
  One body bore them: search the whole malign
    Caïna,[809] and thou shalt not any see
    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;                            60
  Not he whose breast and shadow equally
    Were by one thrust of Arthur's lance[810] pierced through:
    Nor yet Focaccia;[811] nor the one that me
  With his head hampers, blocking out my view,
    Whose name was Sassol Mascheroni:[812] well
    Thou must him know if thou art Tuscan too.
  And that thou need'st not make me further tell--
    I'm Camicion de' Pazzi,[813] and Carlin[814]
    I weary for, whose guilt shall mine excel.'
  A thousand faces saw I dog-like grin,                             70
    Frost-bound; whence I, as now, shall always shake
    Whenever sight of frozen pools I win.
  While to the centre[815] we our way did make
    To which all things converging gravitate,
    And me that chill eternal caused to quake;
  Whether by fortune, providence, or fate,
    I know not, but as 'mong the heads I went
    I kicked one full in the face; who therefore straight
  'Why trample on me?' snarled and made lament,
    'Unless thou com'st to heap the vengeance high                  80
    For Montaperti,[816] why so virulent
  'Gainst me?' I said: 'Await me here till I
    By him, O Master, shall be cleared of doubt;[817]
    Then let my pace thy will be guided by.'
  My Guide delayed, and I to him spake out,
    While he continued uttering curses shrill:
    'Say, what art thou, at others thus to shout?'
  'But who art thou, that goest at thy will
    Through Antenora,[818] trampling on the face
    Of others? 'Twere too much if thou wert still                   90
  In life.' 'I live, and it may help thy case,'
    Was my reply, 'if thou renown wouldst gain,
    Should I thy name[819] upon my tablets place.'
  And he: 'I for the opposite am fain.
    Depart thou hence, nor work me further dool;
    Within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain.'
  Then I began him by the scalp to pull,
    And 'Thou must tell how thou art called,' I said,
    'Or soon thy hair will not be plentiful.'
  And he: 'Though every hair thou from me shred                    100
    I will not tell thee, nor my face turn round;
    No, though a thousand times thou spurn my head.'
  His locks ere this about my fist were wound,
    And many a tuft I tore, while dog-like wails
    Burst from him, and his eyes still sought the ground.
  Then called another: 'Bocca, what now ails?
    Is't not enough thy teeth go chattering there,
    But thou must bark? What devil thee assails?'
  'Ah! now,' said I, 'thou need'st not aught declare,
    Accursed traitor; and true news of thee                        110
    To thy disgrace I to the world will bear.'
  'Begone, tell what thou wilt,' he answered me;
    'But, if thou issue hence, not silent keep[820]
    Of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free.
  He for the Frenchmen's money[821] here doth weep.
    Him of Duera saw I, mayst thou tell,
    Where sinners shiver in the frozen deep.
  Shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell--
    Thou hast the Beccheria[822] at thy side;
    Across whose neck the knife at Florence fell.                  120
  John Soldanieri[823] may be yonder spied
    With Ganellon,[824] and Tribaldell[825] who threw
    Faenza's gates, when slept the city, wide.'
  Him had we left, our journey to pursue,
    When frozen in a hole[826] a pair I saw;
    One's head like the other's hat showed to the view.
  And, as their bread men hunger-driven gnaw,
    The uppermost tore fiercely at his mate
    Where nape and brain-pan to a junction draw.
  No worse by Tydeus[827] in his scornful hate                     130
    Were Menalippus' temples gnawed and hacked
    Than skull and all were torn by him irate.
  'O thou who provest by such bestial act
    Hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed,
    Declare thy motive,' said I, 'on this pact--
  That if with reason thou with him hast feud,
    Knowing your names and manner of his crime
    I in the world[828] to thee will make it good;
  If what I speak with dry not ere the time.'


FOOTNOTES:

[797] _A baby speech_: 'A tongue that cries _mamma_ and _papa_' For his
present purpose, he complains, he has not in Italian an adequate supply
of rough high-sounding rhymes; but at least he will use only the best
words that can be found. In another work (_De Vulg. El._ ii. 7) he
instances _mamma_ and _babbo_ as words of a kind to be avoided by all
who would write nobly in Italian.

[798] _Amphion_: Who with his music charmed rocks from the mountain and
heaped them in order for walls to Thebes.

[799] _The giant's feet_: Antæus. A bank slopes from where the giants
stand inside the wall down to the pit which is filled with the frozen
Cocytus. This is the Ninth and inmost Circle, and is divided into four
concentric rings--Caïna, Antenora, Ptolomæa, and Judecca--where traitors
of different kinds are punished.

[800] _Thy steps_: Dante alone is addressed, the speaker having seen him
set heavily down upon the ice by Antæus.

[801] _A frozen lake_: Cocytus. See _Inf._ xiv. 119.

[802] _Tabernicch_: It is not certain what mountain is here meant;
probably Yavornick near Adelsberg in Carniola. It is mentioned, not for
its size, but the harshness of its name.

[803] _Pietrapana_: A mountain between Modena and Lucca, visible from
Pisa: Petra Apuana.

[804] _Time of year_: At harvest-time, when in the warm summer nights
the wearied gleaner dreams of her day's work.

[805] _To where we blush_: The bodies of the shades are seen buried in
the clear glassy ice, out of which their heads and necks stand free--as
much as 'shows shame,' that is, blushes.

[806] _With breast, etc._: As could be seen through the clear ice.

[807] _Fettered fast_: Binding up their eyes. In the punishment of
traitors is symbolised the hardness and coldness of their hearts to all
the claims of blood, country, or friendship.

[808] _Their father Albert's_: Albert, of the family of the Counts
Alberti, lord of the upper valley of the Bisenzio, near Florence. His
sons, Alexander and Napoleon, slew one another in a quarrel regarding
their inheritance.

[809] _Caïna_: The outer ring of the Ninth Circle, and that in which are
punished those treacherous to their kindred.--Here a place is reserved
for Gianciotto Malatesta, the husband of Francesca (_Inf._ v. 107).

[810] _Arthur's lance_: Mordred, natural son of King Arthur, was slain
by him in battle as a rebel and traitor. 'And the history says that
after the lance-thrust Girflet plainly saw a ray of the sun pass through
the hole of the wound.'--_Lancelot du Lac_.

[811] _Focaccia_: A member of the Pistoiese family of Cancellieri, in
whose domestic feuds the parties of Whites and Blacks took rise. He
assassinated one of his relatives and cut off the hand of another.

[812] _Sassol Mascheroni_: Of the Florentine family of the Toschi. He
murdered his nephew, of whom by some accounts he was the guardian. For
this crime he was punished by being rolled through the streets of
Florence in a cask and then beheaded. Every Tuscan would be familiar
with the story of such a punishment.

[813] _Camicion de' Pazzi_: To distinguish the Pazzi to whom Camicione
belonged from the Pazzi of Florence they were called the Pazzi of
Valdarno, where their possessions lay. Like his fellow-traitors he had
slain a kinsman.

[814] _Carlin_: Also one of the Pazzi of Valdarno. Like all the spirits
in this circle Camicione is eager to betray the treachery of others, and
prophesies the guilt of his still living relative, which is to cast his
own villany into the shade. In 1302 or 1303 Carlino held the castle of
Piano de Trevigne in Valdarno, where many of the exiled Whites of
Florence had taken refuge, and for a bribe he betrayed it to the enemy.

[815] _The centre_: The bottom of Inferno is the centre of the earth,
and, on the system of Ptolemy, the central point of the universe.

[816] _Montaperti_: See _Inf._ x. 86. The speaker is Bocca, of the great
Florentine family of the Abati, who served as one of the Florentine
cavaliers at Montaperti. When the enemy was charging towards the
standard of the Republican cavalry Bocca aimed a blow at the arm of the
knight who bore it and cut off his hand. The sudden fall of the flag
disheartened the Florentines, and in great measure contributed to the
defeat.

[817] _Cleared of doubt_: The mention of Montaperti in this place of
traitors suggests to Dante the thought of Bocca. He would fain be sure
as to whether he has the traitor at his feet. Montaperti was never very
far from the thoughts of the Florentine of that day. It is never out of
Bocca's mind.

[818] _Antenora_: The second ring of the Ninth Circle, where traitors to
their country are punished, named after Antenor the Trojan prince who,
according to the belief of the middle ages, betrayed his native city to
the Greeks.

[819] _Should I thy name, etc._: 'Should I put thy name among the other
notes.' It is the last time that Dante is to offer such a bribe; and
here the offer is most probably ironical.

[820] _Not silent keep, etc._: Like all the other traitors Bocca finds
his only pleasure in betraying his neighbours.

[821] _The Frenchmen's money_: He who had betrayed the name of Bocca was
Buoso of Duera, one of the Ghibeline chiefs of Cremona. When Guy of
Montfort was leading an army across Lombardy to recruit Charles of Anjou
in his war against Manfred in 1265 (_Inf._ xxviii. 16 and _Purg._ iii.),
Buoso, who had been left to guard the passage of the Oglio, took a bribe
to let the French army pass.

[822] _Beccheria_: Tesauro of the Pavian family Beccheria, Abbot of
Vallombrosa and legate in Florence of Pope Alexander IV. He was accused
of conspiring against the Commonwealth along with the exiled Ghibelines
(1258). All Europe was shocked to hear that a great churchman had been
tortured and beheaded by the Florentines. The city was placed under
Papal interdict, proclaimed by the Archbishop of Pisa from the tower of
S. Pietro in Vincoli at Rome. Villani seems to think the Abbot was
innocent of the charge brought against him (_Cron._ vi. 65), but he
always leans to the indulgent view when a priest is concerned.

[823] _Soldanieri_: Deserted from the Florentine Ghibelines after the
defeat of Manfred.

[824] _Ganellon_: Whose treacherous counsel led to the defeat of Roland
at Roncesvalles.

[825] _Tribaldello_: A noble of Faenza, who, as one account says, to
revenge himself for the loss of a pig, sent a cast of the key of the
city gate to John of Apia, then prowling about Romagna in the interest
of the French Pope, Martin IV. He was slain at the battle of Forlì in
1282 (_Inf._ xxvii. 43).

[826] _Frozen in a hole, etc._: The two are the Count Ugolino and the
Archbishop Roger.

[827] _Tydeus_: One of the Seven against Thebes, who, having been
mortally wounded by Menalippus the Theban, whom he slew, got his friends
to bring him the head of his foe and gnawed at it with his teeth. Dante
found the incident in his favourite author Statius (_Theb._ viii.).

[828] _I in the world, etc._: Dante has learned from Bocca that the
prospect of having their memory refreshed on earth has no charm for the
sinners met with here. The bribe he offers is that of loading the name
of a foe with ignominy--but only if from the tale it shall be plain that
the ignominy is deserved.




CANTO XXXIII.


  His mouth uplifting from the savage feast,
    The sinner[829] rubbed and wiped it free of gore
    On the hair of the head he from behind laid waste;
  And then began: 'Thou'dst have me wake once more
    A desperate grief, of which to think alone,
    Ere I have spoken, wrings me to the core.
  But if my words shall be as seed that sown
    May fructify unto the traitor's shame
    Whom thus I gnaw, I mingle speech[830] and groan.
  Of how thou earnest hither or thy name                            10
    I nothing know, but that a Florentine[831]
    In very sooth thou art, thy words proclaim.
  Thou then must know I was Count Ugolin,
    The Archbishop Roger[832] he. Now hearken well
    Why I prove such a neighbour. How in fine,
  And flowing from his ill designs, it fell
    That I, confiding in his words, was caught
    Then done to death, were waste of time[833] to tell.
  But that of which as yet thou heardest nought
    Is how the death was cruel which I met:                         20
    Hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought.
  Scant window in the mew whose epithet
    Of Famine[834] came from me its resident,
    And cooped in which shall many languish yet,
  Had shown me through its slit how there were spent
    Full many moons,[835] ere that bad dream I dreamed
    When of my future was the curtain rent.
  Lord of the hunt and master this one seemed,
    Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs on the height[836]
    By which from Pisan eyes is Lucca hemmed.                       30
  With famished hounds well trained and swift of flight,
    Lanfranchi[837] and Gualandi in the van,
    And Sismond he had set. Within my sight
  Both sire and sons--nor long the chase--began
    To grow (so seemed it) weary as they fled;
    Then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran.
  When I awoke before the morning spread
    I heard my sons[838] all weeping in their sleep--
    For they were with me--and they asked for bread.
  Ah! cruel if thou canst from pity keep                            40
    At the bare thought of what my heart foreknew;
    And if thou weep'st not, what could make thee weep?
  Now were they 'wake, and near the moment drew
    At which 'twas used to bring us our repast;
    But each was fearful[839] lest his dream came true.
  And then I heard the under gate[840] made fast
    Of the horrible tower, and thereupon I gazed
    In my sons' faces, silent and aghast.
  I did not weep, for I to stone was dazed:
    They wept, and darling Anselm me besought:                      50
    "What ails thee, father? Wherefore thus amazed?"
  And yet I did not weep, and answered not
    The whole day, and that night made answer none,
    Till on the world another sun shone out.
  Soon as a feeble ray of light had won
    Into our doleful prison, made aware
    Of the four faces[841] featured like my own,
  Both of my hands I bit at in despair;
    And they, imagining that I was fain
    To eat, arose before me with the prayer:                        60
  "O father, 'twere for us an easier pain
    If thou wouldst eat us. Thou didst us array
    In this poor flesh: unclothe us now again."
  I calmed me, not to swell their woe. That day
    And the next day no single word we said.
    Ah! pitiless earth, that didst unyawning stay!
  When we had reached the fourth day, Gaddo, spread
    Out at my feet, fell prone; and made demand:
    "Why, O my father, offering us no aid?"
  There died he. Plain as I before thee stand                       70
    I saw the three as one by one they failed,
    The fifth day and the sixth; then with my hand,
  Blind now, I groped for each of them, and wailed
    On them for two days after they were gone.
    Famine[842] at last, more strong than grief, prevailed,'
  When he had uttered this, his eyes all thrown
    Awry, upon the hapless skull he fell
    With teeth that, dog-like, rasped upon the bone.
  Ah, Pisa! byword of the folk that dwell
    In the sweet country where the Si[843] doth sound,              80
    Since slow thy neighbours to reward thee well
  Let now Gorgona and Capraia[844] mound
    Themselves where Arno with the sea is blent,
    Till every one within thy walls be drowned.
  For though report of Ugolino went
    That he betrayed[845] thy castles, thou didst wrong
    Thus cruelly his children to torment.
  These were not guilty, for they were but young,
    Thou modern Thebes![846] Brigata and young Hugh,
    And the other twain of whom above 'tis sung.                    90
  We onward passed to where another crew[847]
    Of shades the thick-ribbed ice doth fettered keep;
    Their heads not downward these, but backward threw.
  Their very weeping will not let them weep,
    And grief, encountering barriers at their eyes,
    Swells, flowing inward, their affliction deep;
  For the first tears that issue crystallise,
    And fill, like vizor fashioned out of glass,
    The hollow cup o'er which the eyebrows rise.
  And though, as 'twere a callus, now my face                      100
    By reason of the frost was wholly grown
    Benumbed and dead to feeling, I could trace
  (So it appeared), a breeze against it blown,
    And asked: 'O Master, whence comes this? So low
    As where we are is any vapour[848] known?'
  And he replied: 'Thou ere long while shalt go
    Where touching this thine eye shall answer true,
    Discovering that which makes the wind to blow.'
  Then from the cold crust one of that sad crew
    Demanded loud: 'Spirits, for whom they hold                    110
    The inmost room, so truculent were you,
  Back from my face let these hard veils be rolled,
    That I may vent the woe which chokes my heart,
    Ere tears again solidify with cold.'
  And I to him: 'First tell me who thou art
    If thou'dst have help; then if I help not quick
    To the bottom[849] of the ice let me depart.'
  He answered: 'I am Friar Alberic[850]--
    He of the fruit grown in the orchard fell--
    And here am I repaid with date for fig.'                       120
  'Ah!' said I to him, 'art thou dead as well?'
    'How now my body fares,' he answered me,
    'Up in the world, I have no skill to tell;
  For Ptolomæa[851] has this quality--
    The soul oft plunges hither to its place
    Ere it has been by Atropos[852] set free.
  And that more willingly from off my face
    Thou mayst remove the glassy tears, know, soon
    As ever any soul of man betrays
  As I betrayed, the body once his own                             130
    A demon takes and governs until all
    The span allotted for his life be run.
  Into this tank headlong the soul doth fall;
    And on the earth his body yet may show
    Whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral.
  But thou canst tell, if newly come below:
    It is Ser Branca d'Oria,[853] and complete
    Is many a year since he was fettered so.'
  'It seems,' I answered, 'that thou wouldst me cheat,
    For Branca d'Oria never can have died:                         140
    He sleeps, puts clothes on, swallows drink and meat.'
  'Or e'er to the tenacious pitchy tide
    Which boils in Malebranche's moat had come
    The shade of Michael Zanche,' he replied,
  'That soul had left a devil in its room
    Within its body; of his kinsmen one[854]
    Treacherous with him experienced equal doom.
  But stretch thy hand and be its work begun
    Of setting free mine eyes.' This did not I.
    Twas highest courtesy to yield him none.[855]                  150
  Ah, Genoese,[856] strange to morality!
    Ye men infected with all sorts of sin!
    Out of the world 'tis time that ye should die.
  Here, to Romagna's blackest soul[857] akin,
    I chanced on one of you; for doing ill
    His soul o'erwhelmed Cocytus' floods within,
  Though in the flesh he seems surviving still.


NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.

Ugolino della Gherardesca, Count of Donoratico, a wealthy noble and a
man fertile in political resource, was deeply engaged in the affairs of
Pisa at a critical period of her history. He was born in the first half
of the thirteenth century. By giving one of his daughters in marriage to
the head of the Visconti of Pisa--not to be confounded with those of
Milan--he came under the suspicion of being Guelf in his sympathies; the
general opinion of Pisa being then, as it always had been, strongly
Ghibeline. When driven into exile, as he was along with the Visconti, he
improved the occasion by entering into close relations with the leading
Guelfs of Tuscany, and in 1278 a free return for him to Pisa was made by
them a condition of peace with that city. He commanded one of the
divisions of the Pisan fleet at the disastrous battle of Meloria in
1284, when Genoa wrested from her rival the supremacy of the Western
Mediterranean, and carried thousands of Pisan citizens into a captivity
which lasted many years. Isolated from her Ghibeline allies, and for the
time almost sunk in despair, the city called him to the government with
wellnigh dictatorial powers; and by dint of crafty negotiations in
detail with the members of the league formed against Pisa, helped as was
believed by lavish bribery, he had the glory of saving the Commonwealth
from destruction though he could not wholly save it from loss. This was
in 1285. He soon came to be suspected of being in a secret alliance with
Florence and of being lukewarm in the negotiations for the return of the
prisoners in Genoa, all with a view to depress the Ghibeline element in
the city that he might establish himself as an absolute tyrant with the
greater ease. In order still further to strengthen his position he
entered into a family compact with his Guelf grandson Nino (_Purg._
viii. 53), now at the head of the Visconti. But without the support of
the people it was impossible for him to hold his ground against the
Ghibeline nobles, who resented the arrogance of his manners and were
embittered by the loss of their own share in the government; and these
contrived that month by month the charges of treachery brought against
him should increase in virulence. He had, by deserting his post, caused
the defeat at Meloria, it was said; and had bribed the other Tuscan
cities to favour him, by ceding to them distant Pisan strongholds. His
fate was sealed when, having quarrelled with his grandson Nino, he
sought alliance with the Archbishop Roger who now led the Ghibeline
opposition. With Ugo's connivance an onslaught was planned upon the
Guelfs. To preserve an appearance of impartiality he left the city for a
neighbouring villa. On returning to enjoy his riddance from a rival he
was invited to a conference, at which he resisted a proposal that he
should admit partners with him in the government. On this the
Archbishop's party raised the cry of treachery; the bells rang out for a
street battle, in which he was worsted; and with his sons he had to take
refuge in the Palace of the People. There he stood a short siege against
the Ghibeline families and the angry mob; and in the same palace he was
kept prisoner for twenty days. Then, with his sons and grandsons, he was
carried in chains to the tower of the Gualandi, which stood where seven
ways met in the heart of Pisa. This was in July 1288. The imprisonment
lasted for months, and seems to have been thus prolonged with the view
of extorting a heavy ransom. It was only in the following March that the
Archbishop ordered his victims to be starved to death; for, being a
churchman, says one account, he would not shed blood. Not even a
confessor was allowed to Ugo and his sons. After the door of the tower
had been kept closed for eight days it was opened, and the corpses,
still fettered, were huddled into a tomb in the Franciscan church.--The
original authorities are far from being agreed as to the details of
Ugo's overthrow and death.--For the matter of this note I am chiefly
indebted to the careful epitome of the Pisan history of that time by
Philalethes in his note on this Canto (_Göttliche Comödie_).


FOOTNOTES:

[829] _The sinner_: Count Ugolino. See note at the end of the Canto.

[830] _Mingle speech, etc._: A comparison of these words with those of
Francesca (_Inf._ v. 124) will show the difference in moral tone between
the Second Circle of Inferno and the Ninth.

[831] _A Florentine_: So Farinata (_Inf._ x. 25) recognises Dante by his
Florentine speech. The words heard by Ugo are those at xxxii. 133.

[832] _The Archbishop Roger_: Ruggieri, of the Tuscan family of the
Ubaldini, to which the Cardinal of _Inf._ x. 120 also belonged. Towards
the end of his life he was summoned to Rome to give an account of his
evil deeds, and on his refusal to go was declared a rebel to the Church.
Ugolino was a traitor to his country; Roger, having entered into some
sort of alliance with Ugolino, was a traitor to him. This has led some
to suppose that while Ugolino is in Antenora he is so close to the edge
of it as to be able to reach the head of Roger, who, as a traitor to his
friend, is fixed in Ptolomæa. Against this view is the fact that they
are described as being in the same hole (xxxii. 125), and also that in
Ptolomæa the shades are set with head thrown back, and with only the
face appearing above the ice, while Ugo is described as biting his foe
at where the skull joins the nape. From line 91 it is clear that
Ptolomæa lay further on than where Roger is. Like Ugo he is therefore
here as a traitor to his country.

[833] _Were waste, etc._: For Dante knows it already, all Tuscany being
familiar with the story of Ugo's fate.

[834] _Whose epithet of Famine_: It was called the Tower of Famine. Its
site is now built over. Buti, the old Pisan commentator of Dante, says
it was called the Mew because the eagles of the Republic were kept in it
at moulting-time. But this may have been an after-thought to give local
truth to Dante's verse, which it does at the expense of the poetry.

[835] _Many moons_: The imprisonment having already lasted for eight
months.

[836] _The height, etc._: Lucca is about twelve miles from Pisa, Mount
Giuliano rising between them.

[837] _Lanfranchi, etc._: In the dream, these, the chief Ghibeline
families of Pisa, are the huntsmen, Roger being master of the hunt, and
the populace the hounds. Ugo and his sons and grandsons are the wolf and
wolf-cubs. In Ugo's dream of himself as a wolf there may be an allusion
to his having engaged in the Guelf interest.

[838] _My sons_: According to Dante, taken literally, four of Ugo were
imprisoned with him. It would have hampered him to explain that two were
grandsons--Anselmuccio and Nino, called the Brigata at line 89,
grandsons by their mother of King Enzo, natural son of Frederick
II.--the sons being Gaddo and Uguccione, the latter Ugo's youngest son.

[839] _Each was fearful, etc._: All the sons had been troubled by dreams
of famine. Had their rations been already reduced?

[840] _The under gate, etc._: The word translated _made fast_
(_chiavare_) may signify either to nail up or to lock. The commentators
and chroniclers differ as to whether the door was locked, nailed, or
built up. I would suggest that the lower part of the tower was occupied
by a guard, and that the captives had not been used to hear the main
door locked. Now, when they hear the great key creaking in the lock,
they know that the tower is deserted.

[841] _The four faces, etc._: Despairing like his own, or possibly that,
wasted by famine, the faces of the young men had become liker than ever
to Ugo's own time-worn face.

[842] _Famine, etc._: This line, quite without reason, has been held to
mean that Ugo was driven by hunger to eat the flesh of his children. The
meaning is, that poignant though his grief was it did not shorten his
sufferings from famine.

[843] _Where the Si, etc._: Italy, _Si_ being the Italian for _Yes_.
In his _De Vulg. El._, i. 8, Dante distinguishes the Latin
languages--French, Italian, etc.--by their words of affirmation, and so
terms Italian the language of _Si_. But Tuscany may here be meant,
where, as a Tuscan commentator says, the _Si_ is more sweetly pronounced
than in any other part of Italy. In Canto xviii. 61 the Bolognese are
distinguished as the people who say _Sipa_. If Pisa be taken as being
specially the opprobrium of Tuscany the outburst against Genoa at the
close of the Canto gains in distinctness and force.

[844] _Gorgona and Capraia_: Islands not far from the mouth of the Arno.

[845] _That he betrayed, etc._: Dante seems here to throw doubt on the
charge. At the height of her power Pisa was possessed of many hundreds
of fortified stations in Italy and scattered over the Mediterranean
coasts. The charge was one easy to make and difficult to refute. It
seems hard on Ugo that he should get the benefit of the doubt only after
he has been, for poetical ends, buried raging in Cocytus.

[846] _Modern Thebes_: As Thebes was to the race of Cadmus, so was Pisa
to that of Ugolino.

[847] _Another crew_: They are in Ptolomæa, the third division of the
circle, and that assigned to those treacherous to their friends, allies,
or guests. Here only the faces of the shades are free of the ice.

[848] _Is any vapour_: Has the sun, so low down as this, any influence
upon the temperature, producing vapours and wind? In Dante's time wind
was believed to be the exhalation of a vapour.

[849] _To the bottom, etc._: Dante is going there in any case, and his
promise is nothing but a quibble.

[850] _Friar Alberic_: Alberigo of the Manfredi, a gentleman of Faenza,
who late in life became one of the Merry Friars. See _Inf._ xxiii. 103.
In the course of a dispute with his relative Manfred he got a hearty box
on the ear from him. Feigning to have forgiven the insult he invited
Manfred with a youthful son to dinner in his house, having first
arranged that when they had finished their meat, and he called for
fruit, armed men should fall on his guests. 'The fruit of Friar
Alberigo' passed into a proverb. Here he is repaid with a date for a
fig--gets more than he bargained for.

[851] _Ptolomæa_: This division is named from the Hebrew Ptolemy, who
slew his relatives at a banquet, they being then his guests (1 Maccab.
xvi.).

[852] _Atropos_: The Fate who cuts the thread of life and sets the soul
free from the body.

[853] _Branca d'Oria_: A Genoese noble who in 1275 slew his
father-in-law Michael Zanche (_Inf._ xxii. 88) while the victim sat at
table as his invited guest.--This mention of Branca is of some value in
helping to ascertain when the _Inferno_ was finished. He was in
imprisonment and exile for some time before and up to 1310. In 1311 he
was one of the citizens of Genoa heartiest in welcoming the Emperor
Henry to their city. Impartial as Dante was, we can scarcely think that
he would have loaded with infamy one who had done what he could to help
the success of Henry, on whom all Dante's hopes were long set, and by
their reception of whom on his descent into Italy he continued to judge
his fellow-countrymen. There is considerable reason to believe that the
_Inferno_ was published in 1309; this introduction of Branca helps to
prove that at least it was published before 1311. If this was so, then
Branca d'Oria lived long enough to read or hear that for thirty-five
years his soul had been in Hell.--It is significant of the detestation
in which Dante held any breach of hospitality, that it is as a
treacherous host and not as a treacherous kinsman that Branca is
punished--in Ptolomæa and not in Caïna. Cast as the poet was on the
hospitality of the world, any disloyalty to its obligations came home to
him. For such disloyalty he has invented one of the most appalling of
the fierce retributions with the vision of which he satisfied his
craving for vengeance upon prosperous sin.--It may be that the idea of
this demon-possession of the traitor is taken from the words, 'and after
the sop Satan entered into Judas.'

[854] _Of his kinsmen one_: A cousin or nephew of Branca was engaged
with him in the murder of Michael Zanche. The vengeance came on them so
speedily that their souls were plunged in Ptolomæa ere Zanche breathed
his last.

[855] _To yield him none_: Alberigo being so unworthy of courtesy. See
note on 117. But another interpretation of the words has been suggested
which saves Dante from the charge of cruelty and mean quibbling; namely,
that he did not clear the ice from the sinner's eyes because then he
would have been seen to be a living man--one who could take back to the
world the awful news that Alberigo's body was the dwelling-place of a
devil.

[856] _Ah, Genoese, etc._: The Genoese, indeed, held no good character.
One of their annalists, under the date of 1293, describes the city as
suffering from all kinds of crime.

[857] _Romagna's blackest soul_: Friar Alberigo.




CANTO XXXIV.


  '_Vexilla_[858] _Regis prodeunt Inferni_
    Towards where we are; seek then with vision keen,'
    My Master bade, 'if trace of him thou spy.'
  As, when the exhalations dense have been,
    Or when our hemisphere grows dark with night,
    A windmill from afar is sometimes seen,
  I seemed to catch of such a structure sight;
    And then to 'scape the blast did backward draw
    Behind my Guide--sole shelter in my plight.
  Now was I where[859] (I versify with awe)                         10
    The shades were wholly covered, and did show
    Visible as in glass are bits of straw.
  Some stood[860] upright and some were lying low,
    Some with head topmost, others with their feet;
    And some with face to feet bent like a bow.
  But we kept going on till it seemed meet
    Unto my Master that I should behold
    The creature once[861] of countenance so sweet.
  He stepped aside and stopped me as he told:
    'Lo, Dis! And lo, we are arrived at last                        20
    Where thou must nerve thee and must make thee bold,'
  How I hereon stood shivering and aghast,
    Demand not, Reader; this I cannot write;
    So much the fact all reach of words surpassed.
  I was not dead, yet living was not quite:
    Think for thyself, if gifted with the power,
    What, life and death denied me, was my plight.
  Of that tormented realm the Emperor
    Out of the ice stood free to middle breast;
    And me a giant less would overtower                             30
  Than would his arm a giant. By such test
    Judge then what bulk the whole of him must show,[862]
    Of true proportion with such limb possessed.
  If he was fair of old as hideous now,
    And yet his brows against his Maker raised,
    Meetly from him doth all affliction flow.
  O how it made me horribly amazed
    When on his head I saw three faces[863] grew!
    The one vermilion which straight forward gazed;
  And joining on to it were other two,                              40
    One rising up from either shoulder-bone,
    Till to a junction on the crest they drew.
  'Twixt white and yellow seemed the right-hand one;
    The left resembled them whose country lies
    Where valleywards the floods of Nile flow down.
  Beneath each face two mighty wings did rise,
    Such as this bird tremendous might demand:
    Sails of sea-ships ne'er saw I of such size.
  Not feathered were they, but in style were planned
    Like a bat's wing:[864] by them a threefold breeze--            50
    For still he flapped them--evermore was fanned,
  And through its depths Cocytus caused to freeze.
    Down three chins tears for ever made descent
    From his six eyes; and red foam mixed with these.
  In every mouth there was a sinner rent
    By teeth that shred him as a heckle[865] would;
    Thus three at once compelled he to lament.
  To the one in front 'twas little to be chewed
    Compared with being clawed and clawed again,
    Till his back-bone of skin was sometimes nude.[866]             60
  'The soul up yonder in the greater pain
    Is Judas 'Scariot, with his head among
    The teeth,' my Master said, 'while outward strain
  His legs. Of the two whose heads are downward hung,
    Brutus is from the black jowl pendulous:
    See how he writhes, yet never wags his tongue.
  The other, great of thew, is Cassius:[867]
    But night is rising[868] and we must be gone;
    For everything hath now been seen by us.'
  Then, as he bade, I to his neck held on                           70
    While he the time and place of vantage chose;
    And when the wings enough were open thrown
  He grasped the shaggy ribs and clutched them close,
    And so from tuft to tuft he downward went
    Between the tangled hair and crust which froze.
  We to the bulging haunch had made descent,
    To where the hip-joint lies in it; and then
    My Guide, with painful twist and violent,
  Turned round his head to where his feet had been,
    And like a climber closely clutched the hair:                   80
    I thought to Hell[869] that we returned again.
  'Hold fast to me; it needs by such a stair,'
    Panting, my Leader said, like man foredone,
    'That we from all that wretchedness repair.'
  Right through a hole in a rock when he had won,
    The edge of it he gave me for a seat
    And deftly then to join me clambered on.
  I raised mine eyes, expecting they would meet
    With Lucifer as I beheld him last,
    But saw instead his upturned legs[870] and feet.                90
  If in perplexity I then was cast,
    Let ignorant people think who do not see
    What point[871] it was that I had lately passed.
  'Rise to thy feet,' my Master said to me;
    'The way is long and rugged the ascent,
    And at mid tierce[872] the sun must almost be.'
  'Twas not as if on palace floors we went:
    A dungeon fresh from nature's hand was this;
    Rough underfoot, and of light indigent.
  'Or ever I escape from the abyss,                                100
    O Master,' said I, standing now upright,
    'Correct in few words where I think amiss.
  Where lies the ice? How hold we him in sight
    Set upside down? The sun, how had it skill
    In so short while to pass to morn from night?'[873]
  And he: 'In fancy thou art standing, still,
    On yon side of the centre, where I caught
    The vile worm's hair which through the world doth drill.
  There wast thou while our downward course I wrought;
    But when I turned, the centre was passed by                    110
    Which by all weights from every point is sought.
  And now thou standest 'neath the other sky,
    Opposed to that which vaults the great dry ground
    And 'neath whose summit[874] there did whilom die
  The Man[875] whose birth and life were sinless found.
    Thy feet are firm upon the little sphere,
    On this side answering to Judecca's round.
  'Tis evening yonder when 'tis morning here;
    And he whose tufts our ladder rungs supplied.
    Fixed as he was continues to appear.                           120
  Headlong from Heaven he fell upon this side;
    Whereon the land, protuberant here before,
    For fear of him did in the ocean hide,
  And 'neath our sky emerged: land, as of yore[876]
    Still on this side, perhaps that it might shun
    His fall, heaved up, and filled this depth no more.'
  From Belzebub[877] still widening up and on,
    Far-stretching as the sepulchre,[878] extends
    A region not beheld, but only known
  By murmur of a brook[879] which through it wends,                130
    Declining by a channel eaten through
    The flinty rock; and gently it descends.
  My Guide and I, our journey to pursue
    To the bright world, upon this road concealed
    Made entrance, and no thought of resting knew.
  He first, I second, still ascending held
    Our way until the fair celestial train
    Was through an opening round to me revealed:
  And, issuing thence, we saw the stars[880] again.


FOOTNOTES:

[858] _Vexilla, etc._: '_The banners of the King of Hell advance._' The
words are adapted from a hymn of the Cross used in Holy Week; and they
prepare us to find in Lucifer the opponent of 'the Emperor who reigns on
high' (_Inf._ i. 124). It is somewhat odd that Dante should have put a
Christian hymn into Virgil's mouth.

[859] _Now was I where_: In the fourth and inner division or ring of the
Ninth Circle. Here are punished those guilty of treachery to their
lawful lords or to their benefactors. From Judas Iscariot, the
arch-traitor, it takes the name of Judecca.

[860] _Some stood, etc._: It has been sought to distinguish the degrees
of treachery of the shades by means of the various attitudes assigned to
them. But it is difficult to make more out of it than that some are
suffering more than others. All of them are the worst of traitors,
hard-hearted and cold-hearted, and now they are quite frozen in the ice,
sealed up even from the poor relief of intercourse with their
fellow-sinners.

[861] _The creature once, etc._: Lucifer, guilty of treachery against
the Highest, at _Purg._ xii. 25 described as 'created noble beyond all
other creatures.' Virgil calls him Dis, the name used by him for Pluto
in the _Æneid_, and the name from which that of the City of Unbelief is
taken (_Inf._ viii. 68).

[862] _Judge then what bulk_: The arm of Lucifer was as much longer than
the stature of one of the giants as a giant was taller than Dante. We
have seen (_Inf._ xxxi. 58) that the giants were more than fifty feet in
height--nine times the stature of a man. If a man's arm be taken as a
third of his stature, then Satan is twenty-seven times as tall as a
giant, that is, he is fourteen hundred feet or so. For a fourth of this,
or nearly so--from the middle of the breast upwards--he stands out of
the ice, that is, some three hundred and fifty feet. It seems almost too
great a height for Dante's purpose; and yet on the calculations of some
commentators his stature is immensely greater--from three to five
thousand feet.

[863] _Three faces_: By the three faces are represented the three
quarters of the world from which the subjects of Lucifer are drawn:
vermilion or carnation standing for Europe, yellow for Asia, and black
for Africa. Or the faces may symbolise attributes opposed to the Wisdom,
Power, and Love of the Trinity (_Inf._ iii. 5). See also note on line 1.

[864] _A bat's wing_: Which flutters and flaps in dark and noisome
places. The simile helps to bring more clearly before us the dim light
and half-seen horrors of the Judecca.

[865] _A heckle_: Or brake; the instrument used to clear the fibre of
flax from the woody substance mixed with it.

[866] _Sometimes nude_: We are to imagine that the frame of Judas is
being for ever renewed and for ever mangled and torn.

[867] _Cassius_: It has been surmised that Dante here confounds the pale
and lean Cassius who was the friend of Brutus with the L. Cassius
described as corpulent by Cicero in the Third Catiline Oration. Brutus
and Cassius are set with Judas in this, the deepest room of Hell,
because, as he was guilty of high treason against his Divine Master, so
they were guilty of it against Julius Cæsar, who, according to Dante,
was chosen and ordained by God to found the Roman Empire. As the great
rebel against the spiritual authority Judas has allotted to him the
fiercer pain. To understand the significance of this harsh treatment of
the great Republicans it is necessary to bear in mind that Dante's
devotion to the idea of the Empire was part of his religion, and far
surpassed in intensity all we can now well imagine. In the absence of a
just and strong Emperor the Divine government of the world seemed to him
almost at a stand.

[868] _Night is rising_: It is Saturday evening, and twenty-four hours
since they entered by the gate of Inferno.

[869] _I thought to Hell, etc._: Virgil, holding on to Lucifer's hairy
sides, descends the dark and narrow space between him and the ice as far
as to his middle, which marks the centre of the earth. Here he swings
himself round so as to have his feet to the centre as he emerges from
the pit to the southern hemisphere. Dante now feels that he is being
carried up, and, able to see nothing in the darkness, deems they are
climbing back to the Inferno. Virgil's difficulty in turning himself
round and climbing up the legs of Lucifer arises from his being then at
the 'centre to which all weights tend from every part.' Dante shared the
erroneous belief of the time, that things grew heavier the nearer they
were to the centre of the earth.

[870] _His upturned legs_: Lucifer's feet are as far above where Virgil
and Dante are as was his head above the level of the Judecca.

[871] _What point, etc._: The centre of the earth. Dante here feigns to
have been himself confused--a fiction which helps to fasten attention on
the wonderful fact that if we could make our way through the earth we
should require at the centre to reverse our posture. This was more of a
wonder in Dante's time than now.

[872] _Mid tierce_: The canonical day was divided into four parts, of
which Tierce was the first and began at sunrise. It is now about
half-past seven in the morning. The night was beginning when they took
their departure from the Judecca: the day is now as far advanced in the
southern hemisphere as they have spent time on the passage. The journey
before them is long indeed, for they have to ascend to the surface of
the earth.

[873] _To morn from night_: Dante's knowledge of the time of day is
wholly derived from what Virgil tells him. Since he began his descent
into the Inferno he has not seen the sun.

[874] _'Neath whose summit_: Jerusalem is in the centre of the northern
hemisphere--an opinion founded perhaps on _Ezekiel_ v. 5: 'Jerusalem I
have set in the midst of the nations and countries round about her.' In
the _Convito_, iii. 5, we find Dante's belief regarding the distribution
of land and sea clearly given: 'For those I write for it is enough to
know that the Earth is fixed and does not move, and that, with the
ocean, it is the centre of the heavens. The heavens, as we see, are for
ever revolving around it as a centre; and in these revolutions they must
of necessity have two fixed poles.... Of these one is visible to almost
all the dry land of the Earth; and that is our north pole [star]. The
other, that is, the south, is out of sight of almost all the dry land.'

[875] _The Man_: The name of Christ is not mentioned in the _Inferno_.

[876] _Land, as of yore, etc._: On the fall of Lucifer from the southern
sky all the dry land of that hemisphere fled before him under the ocean
and took refuge in the other; that is, as much land emerged in the
northern hemisphere as sank in the southern. But the ground in the
direct line of his descent to the centre of the earth heaped itself up
into the Mount of Purgatory--the only dry land left in the southern
hemisphere. The Inferno was then also hollowed out; and, as Mount
Calvary is exactly antipodal to Purgatory, we may understand that on the
fall of the first rebels the Mount of Reconciliation for the human race,
which is also that of Purification, rose out of the very realms of
darkness and sin.--But, as Todeschini points out, the question here
arises of whether the Inferno was not created before the earth. At
_Parad_. vii. 124, the earth, with the air and fire and water, is
described as 'corruptible and lasting short while;' but the Inferno is
to endure for aye, and was made before all that is not eternal (_Inf._
iii. 8).

[877] _Belzebub_: Called in the Gospel the prince of the devils. It may
be worth mentioning here that Dante sees in Purgatory (_Purg._ viii. 99)
a serpent which he says may be that which tempted Eve. The
identification of the great tempter with Satan is a Miltonic, or at any
rate a comparatively modern idea.

[878] _The sepulchre_: The Inferno, tomb of Satan and all the wicked.

[879] _A brook_: Some make this to be the same as Lethe, one of the
rivers of the Earthly Paradise. It certainly descends from the Mount of
Purgatory.

[880] _The stars_: Each of the three divisions of the Comedy closes with
'the stars.' These, as appears from _Purg._ i. are the stars of dawn. It
was after sunrise when they began their ascent to the surface of the
earth, and so nearly twenty-four hours have been spent on the
journey--the time it took them to descend through Inferno. It is now the
morning of Easter Sunday--that is, of the true anniversary of the
Resurrection although not of the day observed that year by the Church.
See _Inf._ xxi. 112.
